# Worktrunk PR Review

Review a pull request to worktrunk, a Rust CLI tool for managing git worktrees.

**PR to review:** $ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Pre-flight checks

Before reading the diff, run cheap checks to avoid redundant work. Shell state
doesn't persist between tool calls — re-derive `REPO` in each bash invocation or
combine commands.

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
HEAD_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')


# Find the bot's most recent substantive review (any state).
# Include reviews with a non-empty body OR approvals (LGTM uses --approve -b "").
# Uses "| length > 0" instead of "!= \"\"" to avoid bash ! history expansion.
LAST_REVIEW_SHA=$(gh pr view <number> --json reviews \
  --jq "[.reviews[] | select(.author.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and (.body | length > 0 or .state == \"APPROVED\"))] | last | .commit.oid // empty")
```

If `LAST_REVIEW_SHA == HEAD_SHA`, this commit has already been reviewed — exit
silently. The only exception: a conversation comment asks the bot a question
(checked below).

If the bot reviewed a previous commit (`LAST_REVIEW_SHA` exists but differs from
`HEAD_SHA`), check the incremental changes:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
gh api "repos/$REPO/compare/$LAST_REVIEW_SHA...$HEAD_SHA" \
  --jq '{total: ([.files[] | .additions + .deletions] | add), files: [.files[] | "\(.filename)\t+\(.additions)/-\(.deletions)"]}'
```

If the incremental changes are trivial, skip the full review (steps 2-3) — the
existing review stands. Still proceed to step 6 to resolve any bot threads
addressed by the new changes, then exit. Rough heuristic: changes under ~20
added+deleted lines that don't introduce new functions, types, or control flow
are typically trivial (review feedback addressed, CI/formatting fixes, small
corrections). Only proceed with a full review for non-trivial changes.

Then read all previous bot feedback and conversation:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
# Previous review bodies
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/<number>/reviews" \
  --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and (.body | length > 0)) | {state, body}"
# Inline review comments
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/<number>/comments" --paginate \
  --jq ".[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\") | {path, line, body}"
# Conversation (catch questions directed at the bot)
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/<number>/comments" --paginate \
  --jq '.[] | {author: .user.login, body: .body}'
```

**Do not repeat any point from previous reviews.** If a previous review already
noted an issue, don't raise it again.

If a conversation comment asks the bot a question (mentions `$BOT_LOGIN`,
replies to a bot comment, or is clearly directed at the reviewer), address it in
the review body.

### 2. Read and understand the change

1. Read the PR diff with `gh pr diff <number>`.
2. Before going deeper, look at the PR as a reader would — not just the code,
   but the shape: what files are being added/changed, and does anything look
   off?
3. Read the changed files in full (not just the diff) to understand context.

### 3. Review

Review design first, then tactical checklist.

**Idiomatic Rust and project conventions:**

- Does the code follow Rust idioms? (Iterator chains over manual loops, `?` over
  match-on-error, proper use of Option/Result, etc.)
- Does it follow the project's conventions documented in CLAUDE.md? (Cmd for
  shell commands, error handling with anyhow, accessor naming conventions, etc.)
- Are there unnecessary allocations, clones, or owned types where borrows would
  suffice?

**Code quality:**

- Is the code clear and well-structured?
- Are there simpler ways to express the same logic?
- Does it avoid unnecessary complexity, feature flags, or compatibility layers?

**Correctness:**

- Are there edge cases that aren't handled?
- Could the changes break existing functionality?
- Are error messages helpful and consistent with the project style?
- Does new code use `.expect()` or `.unwrap()` in functions returning `Result`?
  These should use `?` or `bail!` instead — panics in fallible code bypass error
  handling.
- **Trace failure paths, don't just note error handling exists.** For code that
  modifies state through multiple fallible steps, walk through what happens when
  each `?` fires. What has already been mutated? Is the system left in a
  recoverable state? Describing the author's approach ("ordered for safety") is
  not the same as verifying it.

**Testing:**

- Are the changes adequately tested?
- Do the tests follow the project's testing conventions (see tests/CLAUDE.md)?

**Documentation accuracy:**

When a PR changes behavior, check that related documentation still matches.
This is a common source of staleness — new features get added or behavior
changes, but help text, config comments, and doc pages aren't updated.

- Does `after_long_help` in `src/cli/mod.rs` and `src/cli/config.rs` still
  describe what the code does? (These are the primary sources for doc pages.)
- Do inline TOML comments in config examples match the actual behavior?
- Are references to CLI commands still valid? (e.g., a migration note
  referencing `wt config show` when the right command is `wt config update`)
- If a new feature was added, does the relevant help text mention it?

**Same pattern elsewhere:**

When a PR fixes a bug or changes a pattern, search for the same pattern in
other files. A fix applied to one location often needs to be applied to sibling
files. For example, if a PR fixes a broken path in one workflow file, grep for
the same broken path across all workflow files.

```bash
# Example: PR fixes `${{ env.HOME }}` in one workflow — check all workflows
rg 'env\.HOME' .github/workflows/
```

If the same issue exists in files already in the diff, add inline suggestions
fixing each occurrence. If the occurrence is in a file **not in the diff**,
offer to push a fix commit with the correction.

**Duplication check (mandatory for new functions/types):**

For every new public or module-level function added in the diff, search the
codebase for existing functions that do the same thing. LLM-generated code
frequently reinvents internal APIs — this is the highest-value check for
externally contributed PRs.

Two search strategies, both required:

1. **Similar names and signatures.** Search for functions with similar names,
   return types, or parameter types:

   ```bash
   # For a new `detect_pr_provider` function, search for existing detection
   rg "fn detect.*provider|fn get.*platform|fn .*_provider" --type rust
   ```

2. **Overlapping subgoals.** Identify the intermediate steps the new code
   performs (e.g., iterating remotes, parsing URLs, resolving an org name) and
   search for existing code that does the same sub-tasks. Then read the
   functions *that code* consumes — shared helpers often already exist one
   layer down:

   ```bash
   # New code iterates remotes and parses URLs — who else does that?
   rg "all_remote_urls|remote_url|GitRemoteUrl::parse" --type rust
   # New code shells out to `git remote -v` — is there an existing wrapper?
   rg "git remote|remote_urls" --type rust
   ```

If an existing function does substantially the same thing, flag it — reuse is
almost always better than a parallel implementation. If shared helpers exist
for the sub-steps, suggest using them instead of reimplementing.

### 4. Submit

#### Staleness check

Before posting, verify the PR hasn't received new commits since you started:

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
# HEAD_SHA was captured in pre-flight (step 1)
CURRENT_HEAD=$(gh pr view <number> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')
if [ "$CURRENT_HEAD" != "$HEAD_SHA" ]; then
  echo "HEAD moved — newer commit will trigger a fresh review"
  exit 0
fi
```

If HEAD moved, skip posting. A newer workflow run will review the latest code.

#### What to post

Separate internal analysis from postable feedback. The review exists to help the
author improve the code — not to demonstrate understanding.

Every comment must be **actionable** — the author can do something with it:

| Don't post (internal analysis) | Post (actionable) |
|---|---|
| "The fix correctly delegates to `default_config_path()`" | "The error hints still reference `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` but the code uses `etcetera` now" |
| "The threshold logic is correct — spacing reclaim matches allocation" | _(nothing — silence means correct)_ |
| "Good use of `Iterator::scan` here" | "This `.collect::<Vec<_>>()` is only iterated once — can stay as an iterator" |

**Rules:**

- **Don't explain what the code does.** The author wrote it.
- **If the code needs explanation for future readers**, suggest a docstring or
  inline comment — as a code suggestion, not prose.
- **Always use inline suggestions** for concrete fixes — never put replacement
  code as a fenced code block in the review body. If you can name the file,
  line, and new text, it must be a `suggestion` block on that line via the
  review API. The review body is only for summary text.
- **Explain *why*** something should change, not just *what*.
- **Distinguish severity** — "should fix" vs. "nice to have".
- **Don't nitpick formatting** — that's what linters are for.

**Never post a comment with nothing useful to contribute.** If there are no
issues, the author doesn't need to hear that. Use the LGTM verdict (approve
with empty body) or stay silent.

#### Verdict

Decide how confident you are in the change:

```bash
PR_AUTHOR=$(gh pr view <number> --json author --jq '.author.login')
```

**Self-authored PRs:** If `PR_AUTHOR == BOT_LOGIN`, you cannot approve — GitHub
rejects self-approvals. Submit as COMMENT when there are concerns, or stay
silent if there are none.

- **Confident** (small, mechanical, well-tested): Approve.
- **Moderately confident** (non-trivial but looks correct): Approve.

When approving with no issues, approve with an empty body:

```bash
gh pr review <number> --approve -b ""
```

- **Looks good but not confident enough to approve** (unfamiliar module, subtle
  logic, want human eyes): Don't approve. Instead, add a `+1` reaction to
  signal "I reviewed this and it looks reasonable, but a human should decide":

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/issues/<number>/reactions" -f content="+1"
```

  If there are specific observations (not blocking, just noting), combine the
  reaction with a COMMENT review. If there's nothing to say beyond "looks fine
  to me", the reaction alone is sufficient — no review needed.

- **Unsure** (complex logic, edge cases, untested paths): Run tests locally
  (`cargo run -- hook pre-merge --yes`) if the toolchain is available. Otherwise
  submit as COMMENT noting specific concerns.

**Confidence factors:**

Increases confidence: small diffs, existing test coverage, mechanical changes,
author has deep familiarity with the affected code.

Decreases confidence: new algorithms, concurrency, error handling changes,
untested paths, author hasn't contributed to the affected module before,
LLM-generated code (may duplicate existing APIs or miss design intent).

**LLM-generated PRs** have a high rate of
duplicating existing internal APIs because the author lacks codebase context.
Always run the duplication check above, and read the existing modules that the
new code touches (not just the diff) before approving.

**When confidence is low**, go beyond checking the implementation — question the
approach:

- "Does this bypass or duplicate an existing API?"
- "What does this change *not* handle?"
- Check that the fix doesn't introduce a different class of bug (e.g., ignoring
  config overrides, using fixed sleeps instead of polling).
- If the design involves a judgment call, flag it for human review as a COMMENT.

#### Posting

Post exactly one review per run. API calls can succeed server-side while
appearing to hang, so always verify before calling `gh pr review`:
```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/<number>/reviews" \
  --jq "[.[] | select(.user.login == \"$BOT_LOGIN\" and .commit_id == \"$HEAD_SHA\")] | last | .submitted_at // empty"
```
If this returns a timestamp, the review is already posted — you're done.
Otherwise, submit via `gh pr review`. Note that `--comment` requires a non-empty
body (`-b ""` fails) — if there's nothing to say, use the approve-with-empty-body
pattern instead.

- Always give a verdict: **approve** or **comment**. Don't use "request changes"
  (that implies authority to block).
- **Don't use `gh pr comment`** — use review comments (`gh pr review` or
  `gh api` for inline suggestions) so feedback is threaded with the review.
- Don't repeat suggestions already made by humans or previous bot runs
  (checked in step 1).

**Inline suggestions are mandatory for specific fixes.** Whenever there's a
concrete fix (typos, doc updates, naming, missing imports, minor refactors, any
change expressible as replacement lines), post it as an inline suggestion on the
exact line — never as a code block in the review body. Inline suggestions let
the author apply with one click; code blocks in the body force them to find the
line and copy-paste manually.

**Exception: lines outside the diff.** If a fix targets a file or line not in
the diff, offer to push a fix commit instead.

**Anti-pattern — code block in review body:**

> The description on line 3 should be updated:
> ```
> description: new text here
> ```

**Correct — inline suggestion on the line:**

`````bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/<number>/reviews" \
  --method POST \
  -f event=COMMENT \
  -f body="Summary of suggestions" \
  -f 'comments[0][path]=.claude/skills/example/SKILL.md' \
  -f 'comments[0][line]=3' \
  -f 'comments[0][body]=```suggestion
description: new text here
```'
`````

- Use suggestions for any small fix — no limit on count.
- If a review has both suggestions and prose observations, put the suggestions
  as inline comments and the prose in the review body.
- Prose-only comments are for changes too large or uncertain for a direct
  suggestion.
- Multi-line suggestions: set `start_line` and `line` to define the range.
  **Minimize the range** — only include lines that actually need changing. A
  range that's too wide can delete correct code adjacent to the bug. Before
  posting, verify that every line in [`start_line`, `line`] is either removed
  or rewritten in the suggestion body.

### 5. Monitor CI

If you stayed silent (self-authored PR, no concerns) → **done, stop here.**

After approving, monitor CI using the poll approach from `/running-in-ci`.
Exclude the current workflow's own check to avoid a circular wait:

```bash
gh pr checks <number>
```

Poll with `gh pr checks` every 60 seconds until all checks complete.

Then verify final status:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --json statusCheckRollup \
  --jq '[.statusCheckRollup[]
    | select(env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW == null
             or (.workflowName == env.GITHUB_WORKFLOW | not))]
    | .[]
    | {name, status, conclusion}'
```

- **All checks passed** → done, no further action.
- **A check failed** → if it's a flaky test or unrelated infrastructure
  failure, no action needed. If the failure is related to the PR changes:
  1. Investigate the failure and post a follow-up review (COMMENT) with
     analysis, inline suggestions, and an offer to fix. Same rules as
     step 4 — no repeated points from previous reviews. **Post the analysis
     first** — if the session times out before dismissing, a stale approval
     (contradicted by red CI) is better than a bare dismissal with no context.
  2. Dismiss the bot's approval if one exists (empty dismiss message). Skip
     if already dismissed — redundant dismissals create timeline noise.

### 6. Resolve handled suggestions

After submitting the review, check if any unresolved review threads from the bot
have been addressed. You've already read the changed files during review — if a
suggestion was applied or the issue was otherwise fixed, resolve the thread.

Use the file-based GraphQL pattern from `/running-in-ci` to avoid quoting
issues with `$` variables:

```bash
cat > /tmp/review-threads.graphql << 'GRAPHQL'
query($owner: String!, $repo: String!, $number: Int!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    pullRequest(number: $number) {
      reviewThreads(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          id
          isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes {
              author { login }
              path
              line
              body
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
GRAPHQL

REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq '.nameWithOwner')
BOT_LOGIN=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
OWNER=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
NAME=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)

gh api graphql -F query=@/tmp/review-threads.graphql \
  -f owner="$OWNER" -f repo="$NAME" -F number=<number> \
  | jq --arg bot "$BOT_LOGIN" '
    .data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
    | select(.isResolved == false)
    | select(.comments.nodes[0].author.login == $bot)
    | {id, path: .comments.nodes[0].path, line: .comments.nodes[0].line, body: .comments.nodes[0].body}'

# Resolve a thread that has been addressed
cat > /tmp/resolve-thread.graphql << 'GRAPHQL'
mutation($threadId: ID!) {
  resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $threadId}) {
    thread { id }
  }
}
GRAPHQL

gh api graphql -F query=@/tmp/resolve-thread.graphql -f threadId="THREAD_ID"
```

Outdated comments (null line) are best-effort — skip if the original context
can't be located.

### 7. Push mechanical fixes on bot PRs

If the review found concrete, fixable issues on a bot PR (Dependabot, renovate,
etc.) where there's no human author to act on feedback, commit and push the fix
directly to the PR branch.

```bash
gh pr checkout <number>
git add <files>
git commit -m "fix: <description>

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
```

Only do this for mechanical changes where correctness is obvious. For human PRs,
leave inline suggestions for the author instead.
