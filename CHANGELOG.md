# Changelog

## 0.65.0

### Improved

- **Picker `alt-x` flashes why a worktree wasn't removed**: When `alt-x` in the `wt switch` picker keeps a row instead of removing it, the reason now flashes in the picker header for a beat, rather than only draining to stderr after you quit — so the "why" is visible while the row is still in front of you. It covers both the by-design keeps (the current worktree; an unmerged branch-only row shows `○ Kept <branch> — branch is unmerged`) and genuine removal failures (a dirty, locked, or main worktree, shown as an error). The full diagnostic still drains on exit. The `--prs` loading marker now also matches the picker's other in-flight placeholders (`↳ Loading open PRs…`). ([#3336](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3336), [#3350](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3350))

- **`-vv` diagnostics consolidate on `diagnostic.md`, led by the performance profile**: A `-vv` run now opens with a one-line pointer to the log directory (`○ Verbose logging to .git/wt/logs/`) and closes by naming what it captured — `○ Logs, performance profile, and diagnostics saved @ diagnostic.md` — with the raw `trace.jsonl` / `subprocess.log` companions listed beneath and the `gh gist create` bug-report hint. `diagnostic.md` now leads with the performance profile, expanded by default and promoted above the environment / worktree / config dumps; that profile reports the 20 slowest calls (was 8) and 10 same-context redundant-command offenders (was 3). The profile lives in the `diagnostic.md` bundle, and `wt config state logs profile` re-renders it live from `trace.jsonl`. ([#3329](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3329))

### Fixed

- **`wt remove` preserves your subdirectory position**: Removing a worktree from a subdirectory (e.g. `apps/gateway/`) now lands you in the equivalent subdirectory of the destination worktree rather than at its root — matching how `wt switch` already behaves, and falling back to the root when that subdirectory doesn't exist there. `wt merge` lands through the same handler, so it gains the same behavior. ([#3344](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3344), closes [#3343](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3343), thanks @caillou for reporting)

## 0.64.0

### Improved

- **`{{ git.branch.* }}` template namespace for custom columns**: `wt list` custom columns can now read a branch's own git config via `{{ git.branch.<key> }}` — both convention keys you set yourself (`branch.<name>.jira`) and the git-native `branch.<name>.description` — without re-storing the values through `wt config state vars set`. It complements `{{ vars.* }}`, which reads only worktrunk's own state namespace. ([#3319](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3319), thanks @cazador481 for the request)

- **Faster warm-cache `wt list` re-runs**: A repeat `wt list` (with `.git/wt/cache/` already populated) is ~36% faster, by removing redundant per-row git subprocesses — priming the commit→tree cache from the `%ct` batch already issued, persisting merge-base results to a content-addressed on-disk cache, and seeding worktree roots and git-dirs from the single `git worktree list` instead of re-forking `git rev-parse` per worktree. ([#3334](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3334))

### Fixed

- **Refs that look like flags can't inject git options**: `wt`'s `git diff` previews and diffstats (picker diff previews, `show_diffstat`, push diffstat) now fence user-controlled refs behind `--end-of-options`, and branch removal (`git branch -D`) passes them after `--`, so a branch literally named like a flag (`-x`, `--foo`) reaches git as a positional ref instead of being misparsed as an option. ([#3317](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3317))

- **Statusline renders untruncated when `COLUMNS=0`**: `wt list statusline` treated `COLUMNS=0` as a zero-width budget and dropped every segment, rendering an empty line. A zero or unparsable `COLUMNS` is now treated as no detectable width, so the line renders everything untruncated — as the statusline sizing already documented for a missing width. ([#3318](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3318))

- **Watchdog "still waiting" line uses the hint symbol**: The transient `Waiting for the commit message (Ns)` line shown during a slow `wt step commit` LLM call now uses the hint prefix (`↳`) instead of the info symbol (`○`), matching the convention for fully-dim status lines. ([#3330](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3330))

## 0.63.0

### Improved

- **`[list] columns` can force a column on past `--full`**: Listing a column now overrides the `--full` / `[list] summary` presets — `columns = ["branch", "ci"]` shows the CI column without `--full`. Hard data-source prerequisites still apply: a listed `summary` with no `[commit.generation]` command, or `url` with no template, stays hidden, since listing can't conjure data that isn't configured. ([#3295](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3295))

- **`Alt-r` in the picker refreshes the preview panes, not just the rows**: `Alt-r` re-collected the rows but kept serving cached preview content, so editing a tracked file and refreshing still showed the pre-edit diff. It now clears the preview cache too, recomputing the working-tree / log / branch-diff / upstream / summary tabs and re-fetching `pr` / `comments`. Unchanged branches re-read from the content-keyed on-disk cache, so only genuinely changed content pays a recompute. ([#3293](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3293))

- **A narrowed `wt list` is now actually faster**: A narrowed `[list] columns` selection (e.g. `["branch", "path"]`) now runs only the git work its columns need. It previously ran every per-worktree `git status`, diff, and ahead/behind walk regardless, then discarded the unselected results — so a trimmed view was no faster than the full table, and on a repo with many dirty worktrees that discarded work was the bulk of the wall-clock cost. ([#3274](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3274), thanks @jtaby for reporting)

- **Fewer duplicate git calls in `wt list --full`**: The two integration probes per row (the conflict bit for `main-state` and the clean-merge tree for the integration column) issued a byte-identical `git merge-tree`, and the shared default-branch tip was peeled to its tree once per row. Both are now deduplicated through the in-memory cache, so each resolves once per run instead of once per worktree. ([#3288](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3288), [#3289](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3289))

- **Picker `comments` tab avoids redundant forge fetches**: The picker's `comments` preview tab gained an on-disk cache keyed by the PR's `updatedAt` (which rides for free on the CI fetch the picker already makes), so a repeat `wt switch` skips the per-row `gh pr view --json comments` fetch when the thread is unchanged and paints the tab instantly instead of showing "Loading comments…". The cache is also primed from the `gh pr list` call the picker already makes, so the tab skips its own fetch even on a session's first open (including PRs with no comments). GitHub only. ([#3294](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3294), [#3299](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3299))

- **Statusline width comes from `COLUMNS`, not a parent-process walk**: `wt list statusline` used to spawn up to 10 `ps` calls plus `stty` per render to recover a terminal width, because Claude Code piped the subprocess with no inherited TTY. Claude Code now sets `COLUMNS`/`LINES` to the terminal dimensions before running the script (since v2.1.153), so the width comes straight from there — less a fixed 5-column margin for Claude Code's own UI — and the `ps`/`stty` walk is gone. On an older Claude Code that doesn't set `COLUMNS`, the line renders untruncated rather than walking the process tree. ([#3286](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3286), closes [#2950](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2950))

### Fixed

- **`wt list` diff and ahead/behind columns use the upstream default tip**: The `main↕` (ahead/behind) and `main…±` (diff) columns measured every branch against the *local* default-branch tip, so in a fork whose local `main` lagged its upstream they reported inflated counts — one fork branch showed `↑44` and `+∞ / -5K` when it was ~2 commits past the real upstream tip. They now diff against the same upstream-aware base the integration column already uses. ([#3280](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3280))

- **Integrated branches no longer flash `✗` in `wt list`**: A squash-merged branch whose default branch later re-edited the same lines showed `✗` (would-conflict), even though `wt step prune` classified it as `⊂` (fully integrated) and removed it. The list now ranks the integration verdict above the downstream conflict, matching prune; a genuinely un-integrated conflict still shows `✗`. ([#3278](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3278))

- **`wt list` divergence-overflow marker uses one emphasis level**: When an ahead/behind count overflows its digit budget, the `main↕` column's compact `C`/`K`/`∞` marker rendered the "behind" subcolumn as dim + bold (reading as bold red) instead of a clean one-level step. It now steps exactly one level — dim red → normal red — matching the "ahead" subcolumn, across `wt list` and the picker. ([#3303](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3303))

- **Branch deletion on removal is atomic**: `wt remove` and prune now delete a branch with a compare-and-swap (`git update-ref -d <ref> <expected-sha>`) against the SHA the integration check already read, closing the window where a branch whose tip moved in between (e.g. a hook landing a commit) could be deleted. Such a branch is now retained with a clear message and a `wt remove -D <branch>` recovery hint. This also unifies the previously divergent safe-delete paths; explicit force-delete still uses `git branch -D`. ([#2903](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2903))

- **`wt list` and picker Age/Message columns paint as soon as the commit batch lands**: These columns carry no async task — their data arrives with the initial `git log` batch — but stayed on the `·` placeholder until some slower task happened to redraw the row, so the commit message lagged behind a cache-warm Summary preview. They now paint the moment the batch lands. ([#3287](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3287))

- **Picker `Alt-x` removal: no cursor flash, `--prs` rows preserved**: Removing a row with `Alt-x` flashed the `>` pointer to the top of the list for a frame, and in `--prs` mode made the streamed PR/MR rows vanish until the next `Alt-r`. Removal is now a synchronous in-place pool resync: the cursor lands on the row that slid up with no flash, and the PR/MR rows survive. ([#3268](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3268), [#3275](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3275))

- **Removable rows stay gray when selected in the picker**: A safe-to-delete worktree (integrated, or clean and even with the default branch) renders its row gray, but the gray vanished under the selection highlight — exactly when you're about to act on it. The gray now survives selection (selected row only; `wt list` and unselected rows are unchanged). ([#3267](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3267))

- **Picker preview keeps its scroll when CI status arrives**: Scrolling down a diff and waiting a couple of seconds snapped it back to the top when the live CI fetch landed and re-rendered the pane. The re-render is now precise — a tab re-runs only when its own content would actually change — so a CI update no longer throws away the scroll position of an unrelated tab. ([#3292](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3292))

- **Picker summary tab dims when there's nothing to summarize**: The summary preview tab (`5`) stayed lit on a clean branch with no commits ahead, unlike the diff tabs (1/3/4), which dim once their diff is known empty. It now dims in concert with them once both the branch diff and working tree are known empty. ([#3291](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3291))

- **Picker default view keeps collect order**: With no query typed, the `wt switch` picker reordered rows by where each name's last `/` falls, so slash-bearing branches (`feature/…`, `perf/…`) sank toward the bottom and intermixed with other row kinds. The default view now preserves collect order. ([#3301](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3301))

- **Picker branch-diff preview and summary use the upstream-aware base**: Like the `wt list` columns above, the picker's branch-diff preview pane and the LLM branch summary diffed against the raw local default branch, so a fork whose local default lagged upstream made them describe dozens of already-merged commits. They now use the same upstream-aware comparison base. ([#3305](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3305))

- **Picker comment previews render fenced code blocks cleanly**: A fenced code block inside a PR/MR comment rendered as a garbled double gutter in the `wt switch` comments preview — alternating bar/no-bar lines with broken alignment. The code block now renders without the nested gutter. ([#3306](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3306))

- **First-run hints show the config path wt actually loads from**: The picker's disabled-summary tab and the commit-generation setup prompt hardcoded `~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`, so a user with `--config`, `WORKTRUNK_CONFIG_PATH`, or a non-default `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` was told to edit a file wt never reads. Both now show the resolved path. ([#3290](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3290), [#3298](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3298))

### Internal

- **`-vv` trace and profiler accuracy**: `trace.log` is now purely human-readable, with the machine-parseable `[wt-trace]` fields living only in `trace.jsonl`; and the performance profile's cache analysis no longer reports stdin-driven commands (LLM `claude -p` calls, `git patch-id`) as duplicate re-runs, since their real input isn't captured in the command string. ([#3296](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3296), [#3297](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3297))

## 0.62.0

### Improved

- **Browse open PRs/MRs in the `wt switch` picker, with live CI**: The picker now streams a live CI/review-status column per row — priming from the local cache, then fetching live (it previously showed only cached numbers with no network). A new `--prs` flag adds the repository's open PRs (GitHub) / MRs (GitLab) as rows alongside your worktrees, each with `pr` / `comments` / `log` preview tabs loaded from the forge in the background; selecting one fetches its branch and switches. Rows whose branch is already shown aren't duplicated, so `--prs` differs from plain `wt switch` only by the extra rows. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/) ([#3128](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3128), [#3169](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3169), [#3189](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3189), [#3252](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3252))

- **`main…±` diff column shows by default in `wt list`**: The `main…±` column (lines changed since the merge-base with the default branch) now renders in the default `wt list` and picker, served from a persistent cache rather than a history walk. `--full` now adds only the columns that reach off-machine — CI status and LLM branch summaries — and `wt list --format=json` populates `main.diff` for every item, not just under `--full`. ([#3236](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3236))

- **`[list] columns` selects and orders the columns `wt list` shows**: A new `[list] columns` user-config key (also settable via `--config-set`) takes an ordered array of column names — built-in (`branch`, `status`, `ci`, `path`, …) and `[list.custom-columns]` headers alike — and renders exactly those, in that order. Where v0.61.0's custom columns *add* columns, this *selects and reorders* the whole set; omit the key for the default layout. (`WORKTRUNK__LIST__COLUMNS` isn't supported yet and warns if set.) ([#3141](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3141))

- **Picker PR preview shows full PR/MR detail**: The `pr` tab now renders the PR/MR title, markdown description, author, draft state, comment count, bold branch name, and underlined URL for any row whose branch has an open PR — not just `--prs` rows — and the `comments` tab fetches the real thread. The title and description ride the CI fetch the picker already makes; the comment thread is fetched lazily in the background, once per row. ([#3167](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3167), [#3197](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3197), [#3223](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3223), [#3195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3195), [#3231](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3231))

- **Interactive picker runs on Windows**: The `wt switch` picker was Unix-only because its preview-tab keys shelled out through a per-process state file `cmd.exe` lacks; tab state moved to an in-memory atomic with native skim callbacks, lifting the platform gate. ([#3217](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3217))

- **Picker keyboard shortcuts**: `Alt-y` copies the selected branch name, `Alt-o` opens the row's PR/MR in the browser, and `Alt-r` refreshes the list (picking up worktrees created or removed elsewhere). (Breaking: in the picker, remove moved from `Alt-r` to `Alt-x`) ([#3233](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3233))

- **Picker uses the full terminal**: List height scales with the terminal (a roughly even split with the preview, minimum 3 rows) instead of a fixed 12-row cap, the table lays out at full width so toggling the preview off with `Alt-p` reveals the freed columns with no reflow, and a scrollbar appears when the list overflows. ([#3205](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3205), [#3214](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3214), [#3198](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3198))

- **Picker filters on more of each row**: Typing a gutter sigil filters by row kind (`+` for linked worktrees, `@` for the current one), the fuzzy matcher ranks on the distinguishing path segment rather than the shared parent prefix, and rows with a PR/MR also match on its number, title, and author. ([#3143](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3143), [#3208](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3208), [#3252](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3252))

- **Picker visual polish**: The legend recolored to dim-cyan and reordered so navigation leads, and preview loading placeholders moved to the dim-hint style (`↳` transient, `○` settled, `▲` failed). ([#3237](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3237), [#3253](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3253))

- **"Still waiting" status for slow commit-message generation**: A configured `commit.generation` command captures stdout, so a slow or hung LLM previously showed nothing while `wt step commit`/`squash` waited. After a 2s delay worktrunk now shows a dim, in-place `○ Waiting for the commit message (Ns)` status, escalating at 10s to reveal the exact shell-escaped invocation in a gutter beneath it; the block clears on completion, mirroring `wt list`'s stall footer. ([#3178](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3178))

- **"Still waiting" status extended to more slow commands**: The same waiting status now covers three more foreground commands that were silent while a captured subprocess ran — the `wt config show --full` commit-generation self-test, the `wt switch pr:`/`mr:` host lookup, and the `wt config show --full` version check. The version check no longer caps its fetch at an aggressive 5s, instead showing the status while a slow-but-working request completes (with a generous ceiling so a non-interactive run can't hang). ([#3183](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3183))

- **`wt config state logs profile` performance profiler**: A new subcommand turns a `-vv` `[wt-trace]` capture (a path argument, `-` for stdin, or the default `trace.log`) into a performance profile: subprocess time by command shape, the slowest calls, parallelism and peak concurrency, redundant cache-miss re-runs, and — for `wt list`/picker captures — derived latencies and a collect timeline. `--format=json` emits the same data, and every `-vv` bug-report bundle now inlines a rendered profile. ([#3184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3184), [#3186](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3186))

- **`WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE` env var**: `WORKTRUNK_VERBOSE=0|1|2` mirrors `-v`/`-vv`, combined with any flag via `max` (the env sets a floor the flag can raise). Unlike the flags it's honored on the shell-completion path, which returns before flag parsing — so a slow tab-completion can be profiled for the first time. ([#3166](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3166))

- **Aliases inherit the wrapped command's completion**: An alias that forwards `{{ args }}` to a single `wt` command (`co = "wt switch {{ args }}"`) now completes that command's arguments and flags — `wt co <Tab>` completes branches like `wt switch <Tab>` — instead of a generic stub. Bare dispatchers and multi-`{{ args }}` aliases keep the stub. ([#3172](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3172), thanks @yzx9)

- **`wt step copy-ignored --require-include`**: A new `--require-include` flag makes the copy a no-op unless a `.worktreeinclude` file exists in the source worktree (matching Claude Code desktop, where that file is required), reporting why it skipped as a hint in text mode and a `reason` field in `--format=json`. ([#3196](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3196), thanks @yzx9)

- **`wt step tether` honors `-C`**: The global `-C <path>` flag now sets the tethered command's working directory (`wt step tether -C frontend -- npm run dev`); teardown still watches the worktree root, so the command is reaped when the worktree is removed. ([#3207](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3207))

- **Statusline rate-limit pace color grades by severity**: The pace segment's color now deepens (dim → dim-yellow → yellow) with the projected throttling severity, so an early-window burst stays muted while a costly projected lockout stands out. The displayed pace number is unchanged. ([#3229](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3229))

### Fixed

- **Picker `Alt-x` removal updates the row in place**: Removing a worktree no longer re-collects the whole list (a flicker that reset the cursor to the top): an unmerged worktree's row morphs into a branch-only row while the worktree is removed in the background, and a merged worktree's row drops with the cursor landing on the row that slid up. A removal that can't safely happen — the current or main worktree, or a dirty or locked one — is declined with the same diagnostic `wt remove` prints, rather than a dead keypress or a disruptive `cd` home. The post-removal cursor lands by row identity, so it stays correct even under an active filter. ([#3262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3262), [#3199](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3199), [#3211](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3211), [#3225](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3225))

- **Picker preview refreshes when its background fetch lands**: A diff/log/PR-view fetch that completed after its triggering keystroke used to sit unshown until the next keypress; the pane now updates on its own when the fetch lands. ([#3247](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3247))

- **Picker rows stay aligned while filtering**: Typing a filter no longer slides the matched row left and drops its leading sigil, and `Alt-l`/`Alt-h` no longer scroll the list off its gutter. ([#3213](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3213), [#3226](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3226))

- **fish completions no longer recurse to the call-stack limit**: With worktrunk's fish lazy-load wrapper installed, completion could re-enter the wrapper and recurse until fish hit its call-stack limit. The package-manager registration now resolves the real binary via `type -P` instead of calling the bare `wt`, and the wrapper stub short-circuits in completion mode the way the bash and zsh wrappers already did. ([#3241](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3241), [#3250](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3250); fixes [#3240](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3240), thanks @maciej-lech for reporting)

- **`wt switch` changes directory under fish with `zoxide.fish`**: The fish integration used a bare `cd`, which the `kidonng/zoxide.fish` plugin intercepts as a fuzzy query, so a switch reported success but failed with `zoxide: no match found`. The wrapper now uses `builtin cd`, bypassing any user `cd` override. ([#3160](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3160), fixes [#3159](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3159), thanks @anon-legion for reporting)

- **`wt switch pr:N` resolves Azure DevOps projects with encoded path segments**: Azure returns decoded project names while git remotes store them URL-encoded, so a project like `project with spaces` failed to match. Path segments are now canonicalized before comparing remotes and building Azure URLs. ([#3204](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3204), fixes [#3203](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3203), thanks @jonasherfort)

- **Recommended Claude Code commit command preserves `apiKeyHelper` auth**: The suggested `[commit.generation]` command for Claude Code used `--setting-sources=''`, which dropped user settings and broke authentication for setups that get their key via `apiKeyHelper`. It now uses `--safe-mode --setting-sources='user'`: the run stays hermetic (no hooks, plugins, MCP, skills, or CLAUDE.md) but loads user settings so `apiKeyHelper` works (requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.169). Existing user configs are not rewritten. ([#3170](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3170))

- **Claude Code paths honor `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`**: worktrunk hardcoded `~/.claude` for every Claude Code path, so on a machine that relocates the config tree via `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `wt config show` wrongly reported the plugin and statusline as not installed and `install-statusline` wrote to a stray file Claude Code never reads. All three call sites now resolve through `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, falling back to `~/.claude`. ([#3215](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3215), thanks @tftio)

- **Deprecated config keys migrate in `--config-set`, env vars, and inline tables**: Deprecated keys were rewritten to canonical form only in config files; passed any other way they fell through as unknown fields and were silently dropped. `wt --config-set 'merge.no-ff=true'`, `WORKTRUNK__MERGE__NO_FF=true`, and the inline `merge = { no-ff = true }` form now all migrate and take effect. ([#3152](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3152), [#3158](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3158))

- **`wt config show` can't hang on the zsh compinit probe**: The interactive `zsh -ic` probe that checks whether compinit is configured could hang indefinitely on compinit's insecure-directories prompt; it now has a 2s kill-on-timeout, declining to warn on timeout. ([#3165](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3165))

- **Empty branch-name arguments rejected at the parse boundary**: An empty value (e.g. `wt step diff --branch=`) was accepted and produced a garbled downstream diagnostic; all branch-name arguments now reject empty or whitespace-only values at the CLI edge with a standard usage error. A real missing branch still gets its normal "no worktree" diagnostic. ([#3179](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3179))

- **`wt list` JSON and help-text accuracy**: The `wt list` help text and web docs now note which `--format=json` objects (`ci`, `summary`) require `--full`, and the status-symbol reference tables name each JSON field by type — correcting a wrong "only the first matching symbol is shown" note and an unreachable `worktree.state` value. ([#3139](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3139), [#3220](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3220), [#3224](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3224))

### Internal

- **Richer `-vv` diagnostics**: `-vv` now also writes a machine-readable `trace.jsonl` (one JSON object per event) alongside `trace.log`, segments `subprocess.log` into per-command blocks joined to the trace by a `seq` field, and lists each log path on its own line; worktrunk's own log sites moved to native `tracing`. ([#3232](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3232), [#3182](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3182), [#3163](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3163))

## 0.61.0

### Improved

- **`wt list` custom columns**: Each `[list.custom-columns.<Header>]` entry in user config adds a column to `wt list` (and the `wt switch` picker), rendered per row as a minijinja template over `branch`, `worktree_path`, `worktree_name`, and `vars.*`, with optional `width` and drop priority. Values expand from in-memory data only — no subprocess runs per cell — and a column that is empty on every row is dropped. `wt list --format=json` gains a `columns` map per item. The feature is experimental, so the config shape may still change. ([#3073](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3073), thanks @Faria22, whose [#3065](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3065) prototyped configurable `wt list` column visibility and motivated this area)

- **`--config-set` for inline config overrides**: A global, repeatable `--config-set <toml>` flag overrides any user-config key for a single invocation, layered above config files and `WORKTRUNK_*` env vars. The value is a real TOML fragment, so arrays and tables work natively (`wt --config-set list.full=true list`); nested tables deep-merge, and a malformed or invalid override drops the whole `--config-set` layer with an attributed warning rather than failing the command. ([#3138](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3138))

- **Picker shows cached PR/MR numbers**: The `wt switch` picker skips the networked CI-status fetch, so it previously had no CI column. It now fills PR/MR numbers from the local `.git/wt/cache/ci-status/` cache populated by earlier `wt list --full` or statusline runs, with zero network access. A stale entry (TTL passed or branch head moved) keeps its number dimmed; expired entries without a number are dropped. ([#3073](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3073))

- **Faster file copies on macOS**: After a reflink (`clonefile` on APFS, which already preserves mode bits), worktrunk now skips the redundant follow-up `chmod` on macOS, saving one syscall per file in `wt step copy-ignored` and every other copy path. Linux (btrfs/XFS) still sets permissions, since `FICLONE` clones data extents only and drops the execute bit. ([#3149](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3149))

### Internal

- **Picker migrated to skim 4.8 (ratatui/crossterm)**: The `wt switch` picker moved off skim 0.20.5 (tuikit) to skim 4.8.0, dropping the vendored `vendor/skim-tuikit/` patch tree (both patches it carried are now native or upstream). Two cosmetic picker changes come with it: the match counter no longer overlaps the preview-tab header, and the HEAD column shows the full short-SHA. ([#3137](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3137))

- **All command spawns route through one trace chokepoint**: `CommandTrace` is now the sole emitter of `[wt-trace]` command records, so a spawn path can't silently skip tracing — `git worktree add`, previously an unattributed gap, now shows up as a labeled slice in `wt-perf timeline`. ([#3134](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3134))

### Documentation

- **Hook-approval skill guidance**: The bundled worktrunk skill now frames hook approvals as user consent and no longer advocates `--yes` to bypass prompts. ([#3146](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3146))

## 0.60.0

### Improved

- **Package installs complete branch and worktree names**: A plain `brew install worktrunk` (or other package install) now tab-completes branch and worktree names, not just subcommands and flags. `wt config shell completions <shell>` emits a dynamic registration that calls the binary at completion time (the maintained `clap_complete::env` path), matching what `gh`, `rustup`, and `kubectl` ship. ([#3105](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3105), thanks @bendrucker)

- **`wt step relocate` moves dirty linked worktrees**: Relocating a linked worktree with uncommitted or untracked changes no longer skips it. `git worktree move` carries those files along, so the dirty-skip was a worktrunk policy rather than a git limitation. The main worktree still skips when dirty (without `--commit`), since its relocation falls back to `git checkout`, which refuses to switch over a dirty tree. ([#3104](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3104), thanks @lunaynx for reporting)

- **`--dry-run` previews print to stdout**: `wt hook <type>`, `wt step relocate`, `wt step prune`, `wt step copy-ignored`, and `wt config shell install`/`uninstall` now send their `--dry-run` preview to stdout (the command's answer) while narration stays on stderr. This matches `wt list`, `git clean -n`, and `terraform plan`, and keeps previews pageable and pipeable. (Breaking: scripts reading these previews from stderr should now read stdout) ([#3085](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3085))

- **Picker gutter distinguishes local and remote branches**: With `--branches` and `--remotes`, the `wt switch` picker marks each row's kind in the gutter: `/` for a local branch without a worktree and `|` for a remote branch, alongside the existing `@`/`^`/`+` worktree glyphs. ([#3115](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3115))

- **`wt list --format=json` gains structured `repo` metadata**: JSON output adds `repo` (the local checkout's primary remote) and `ci.repo` (the repository `ci.url` targets, which differs for fork PRs) objects carrying `host`/`owner`/`name`/`provider`; the existing `repo_url` and `ci.repo_url` strings remain. The provider honors the configured `[forge].platform` on hosts that can't be auto-detected. ([#3021](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3021), thanks @jeremy0dell)

- **`wt step eval --format=json`**: `wt step eval` gains a structured `{name, template, result}` JSON lane on stdout, the machine-readable analog of its `-v` view. Text mode is unchanged. ([#3106](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3106))

- **`--format=claude-code` rejected where it never applied**: `wt list` and `wt config state get` accepted `--format=claude-code` silently and treated it as `table`; the value only ever meant anything on `wt list statusline`. Both now fail fast with `invalid value 'claude-code'`. (Breaking: `wt list --format=claude-code` and `wt config state get --format=claude-code` now error) ([#3116](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3116))

### Fixed

- **`cargo install worktrunk` builds from crates.io**: Installing from crates.io failed to compile with `environment variable VERGEN_GIT_DESCRIBE not defined at compile time`, because the package archive has no `.git` for the build script to read. The version lookup now falls back to the cargo package version when git-describe is unavailable. ([#3124](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3124), fixes [#3123](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3123), thanks @kerrickstaley for reporting)

- **Tab-completion works in repos with no commits**: `wt switch <TAB>` and `wt remove <TAB>` returned nothing on a fresh `git init` repo, because the unborn default branch has no entry under `refs/heads/`. Completion now also draws on worktree branches, so the unborn `main` (and any `wt switch --create` branch on an empty repo) completes. ([#3097](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3097), closes [#3094](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/3094))

- **`wt config state get ci-status --format=json` honors `[forge].platform`**: On a self-hosted host the parser can't recognize (Gitea, Azure DevOps, GitHub Enterprise on a generic domain), this path reported `provider: "unknown"` while `wt list --format=json` reported the configured provider. All structured-output paths now route the `[forge].platform` override through one accessor, so they stay consistent. ([#3120](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3120))

### Documentation

- **`wt list --help` example tables fit the terminal**: The captured `wt list` example tables in `--help` chop to terminal width with a dimmed ellipsis (matching real `wt list`) instead of word-wrapping and shearing their columns; hand-authored command examples still wrap. ([#3125](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3125))

- **`/wt-switch-create` cross-repo handling reworked**: The Claude Code plugin command's skill reworks how it creates and enters a worktree in another repo, built around what the harness actually does (`EnterWorktree` re-roots within the current repo; a `cd` reaches another repo when it's in `additionalDirectories`). The procedure dropped from five steps to three. ([#3118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3118))

- **Help-text and docs refinements**: `--format` help renders its values inline (`[possible values: table, json]`) instead of an expanded block; `wt switch` and `wt step push` help got smaller clarifications; and web-doc terminal blocks no longer wrap command-only lines. ([#3096](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3096), [#3108](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3108), [#3110](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3110), [#3112](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3112), [#3126](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3126))

## 0.59.0

### Improved

- **Picker frees digit keys for filtering; preview tabs move to `Alt`**: In the `wt switch` picker, plain digits now go to the filter, so a branch name with a number in it can be typed directly. Preview tabs jump with `Alt-1`–`Alt-5` or cycle with `Tab`/`Shift-Tab`. (Breaking: `1`–`5` no longer switch preview tabs) ([#3079](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3079))

- **Squash templates use `commit_details` instead of `commits`**: The squash commit-message template's `{{ commits }}` variable (commit subjects) is deprecated in favor of `{{ commit_details }}`, which renders as the bare subject when printed directly and also exposes `.subject` and `.body`. `wt config update` migrates `commits` to `commit_details` as a plain rename. ([#2985](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2985))

- **`wt step eval -v` lists template variables**: `wt step eval -v` now prints the available template variables on stderr in the gutter style, above the template-expansion view. That expansion (also shown by `wt switch -v`, hooks, aliases, and `wt -v list`) renders the template and its result as separate labeled `source` / `result` blocks rather than a shared gutter. The result still goes to stdout, so `$(wt step eval …)` is unchanged. Since `eval` mutates nothing and is experimental, its `--dry-run` flag (which dumped the raw variable context) is removed rather than deprecated. ([#3078](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3078), [#3099](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3099))

### Fixed

- **Picker no longer freezes on the first keystroke**: With many worktrees, typing the first character in the `wt switch` picker locked the UI for several seconds. The fuzzy matcher shares rayon's global thread pool with worktrunk's git collection, which floods it with blocking subprocess calls, so the matcher queued behind them. Collection and preview work now run on a dedicated pool, keeping the matcher responsive. ([#3087](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3087), thanks @bendrucker; fixes [#2926](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2926), thanks @mahume for reporting)

- **Tab-completion covers all hook types**: `wt hook <type> <Tab>` completed configured command names for only seven of the ten hook types; `pre-switch`, `post-switch`, and `post-remove` returned nothing. Completion now derives the type from the canonical hook list, so every type completes its command names. ([#3070](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3070))

- **Ctrl-C on a concurrent alias reports the right exit code**: Interrupting `wt step <concurrent-alias>` could report exit 143 (SIGTERM) instead of 130 (SIGINT), because a per-child SIGINT → SIGTERM → SIGKILL escalation could land a SIGTERM on a child during the grace window; the escalation also serialized across process groups, so repeated Ctrl-C could wait. wt now forwards the user's signal once per process group, so a cooperative child dies from the signal actually sent (130 on Ctrl-C); a second signal kills any survivor immediately. ([#3075](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3075))

### Documentation

- **Per-worktree env vars**: A Tips & Patterns section shows how to give each worktree its own environment variables with direnv or mise. ([#3074](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3074))

### Internal

- The commit-generation command is not rewritten to disk when its value is unchanged. ([#3084](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3084))

## 0.58.0

### Improved

- **Table-form `pre-*` hooks run concurrently**: A multi-entry table hook (`[pre-merge]` with several keys) now runs its commands concurrently, completing the cut-over announced in v0.37.0: every hook type has one execution semantic, where table form is concurrent and pipeline form (`[[pre-merge]]` blocks) is serial. Configs that need ordering should use pipeline form; affected configs have warned on every invocation since v0.37.0, with `wt config update` offering a serial-preserving migration. Two adjacent inconsistencies are also gone: `wt hook <post-type>` foreground runs of multi-entry table hooks now run concurrently like their background counterpart, and single-entry table aliases write to stdout like the other alias spellings, so `wt <alias> | …` works for that spelling too. (Breaking: multi-entry table-form `pre-*` hooks no longer run serially) ([#3052](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3052))

- **CI column shows the PR/MR number and review state**: The CI column in `wt list --full` and the statusline shows the branch's open PR/MR reference (`#3041` on GitHub/Gitea/Azure DevOps, `!3041` on GitLab) instead of a plain dot: colored by CI status, hyperlinked to the PR, dimmed when stale or draft. Review state folds into the color, with magenta for changes requested and cyan for awaiting review. `wt list --format=json` gains `ci.number` and `ci.review_state`. ([#3041](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3041), [#3044](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3044))

- **Hook and alias templates render when each step runs**: Templates are syntax-checked before the first step runs and rendered as each step executes, so `{{ vars.* }}` always reads fresh values and hooks and aliases share one expansion model. Two consequences: a pipeline step with an undefined variable fails when that step is reached (earlier steps run first), and a template error in a background hook surfaces in the hook log rather than failing the foreground command. The background runner also labels template errors the way the foreground does. ([#3042](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3042), [#3047](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3047))

- **`wt config state cache`**: The regenerable caches (CI status, branch summaries, git-command caches, hints, the `wt switch -` target) are consolidated under `wt config state cache`; `cache clear` drops them all without prompting, since everything regenerates. `wt config state clear`, which also wipes hand-authored markers and vars, now asks for confirmation; `--yes` skips, and non-interactive runs without `--yes` cancel. The `ci-status`, `hints`, and `previous-branch` subcommands are deprecated but still work. ([#3027](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3027))

- **Statusline rate-limit segment**: Above 90% of the binding window the segment shows the used percentage (`95%(8:30am–1:30pm)`) instead of the pace ratio; near the cap, what's left matters more than the rate. The pace form drops the word "pace" (`2.9×(Tue–Tue 5pm)`), and `-vv` logs each window's inputs and selection to `.git/wt/logs/trace.log` so the binding-window choice can be reconstructed. ([#3057](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3057), [#3053](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3053), [#3029](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3029))

- **`/wt-switch-create` branch name is optional**: The Claude Code plugin command picks a branch name from the task when none is given, and the skill's workflow is one route (create, then enter) with an error-driven fallback instead of three guarded paths. Worktrees created mid-session persist after the session ends. ([#3058](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3058))

### Fixed

- **Plugin worktree hooks fail before side effects**: The Claude Code plugin's `WorktreeCreate`/`WorktreeRemove` hooks validate the payload before running `wt`; a malformed payload previously created a branch named `null` or could remove the wrong worktree. `wt remove`'s help now documents that the positional argument accepts a worktree path as well as a branch name. ([#3058](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3058), [#3060](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3060))

- **Waiting-for-input marker covers questions, permission prompts, and turn end**: The Claude Code plugin sets the 💬 marker on `AskUserQuestion`, permission requests, and turn end. Previously only the `Notification` event set it, which never fires for the built-in question picker (and on some platforms not for permission prompts), so the marker stayed 🤖 while Claude waited. Part of [#2916](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2916). ([#3023](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3023), thanks @Ismael for reporting)

- **`wt list --help` no longer panics when piped**: With no detectable terminal width (output piped, `COLUMNS` unset), `wt list --help` panicked with a capacity overflow, and the post-commit diffstat truncated filenames to ~10 characters. Both now handle unknown width. ([#3040](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3040))

- **Deprecation warnings match `wt config update`**: A config deprecation warning now fires exactly when `wt config update` would change the file. The old detection and migration logic had drifted in several places: `ff` and `no-ff` together silently dropped `no-ff`, a scalar `forge` key was overwritten by the `[ci]` migration, an empty `[ci] platform` migrated without warning, and an empty `approved-commands = []` could be removed by an unrelated update. ([#3055](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3055))

- **Migrated `[forge]` keeps `[ci]`'s spot**: The `[ci]` → `[forge]` migration rendered the new section at the end of the file and could drop comments above `[ci]`; it now takes over `[ci]`'s position, comments included, so `wt config show` and `wt config update` diffs stay minimal. ([#3051](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3051))

- **`wt config state get` is read-only**: The aggregate dump resolved (and re-cached) the default branch, so running it right after `clear` silently repopulated the cache, and on a cold clone it could hit the network. It now reports the cached value or `(none)`. `wt config state default-branch get` still resolves and caches. ([#3024](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3024))

### Documentation

- **Reading vs resolving cached state**: `wt config state default-branch get` resolves and caches; the aggregate `wt config state get` only reports the cache. The help text and module docs now state the split. ([#3028](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3028))

### Internal

- `wt switch`/`wt remove` orchestration moved from `main.rs` to their command modules, and the hook execution call chain lost two delegation layers. ([#3049](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3049), [#3036](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3036))

- Config deprecations are driven by a single rule table; each rule is one function that migrates and reports what it changed. ([#3045](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3045), [#3055](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3055))

- `terminal_width()` returns `Option<usize>` instead of a `usize::MAX` sentinel, making the no-width case a compile-time concern. ([#3043](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3043))

- Snapshot tests regenerate identically across machines: host-specific paths are guarded, host-dependent env-block markers are normalized, and help snapshots share one settings builder. ([#3009](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3009), [#3026](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3026), [#3037](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3037), [#3061](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3061))

- Nightly CI runs lib tests across the full feature powerset. ([#3059](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3059))

- MSRV bumped from 1.94 to 1.95. ([#2948](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2948))

## 0.57.0

### Improved

- **`wt step diff --branch`**: `wt step diff` gained a `-b`/`--branch` flag, mirroring `wt step commit`, so the diff can target another worktree's branch without leaving the current one. The branch must have a checked-out worktree. ([#2995](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2995))

- **Squash templates can use commit bodies**: The squash commit-message template gains an experimental `{{ commit_details }}` variable — a list of `{ subject, body }` objects for the commits being squashed — alongside the existing `{{ commits }}` (now documented as the commit subjects). Templates can incorporate full commit bodies, not just subject lines. ([#2983](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2983), thanks @florianilch)

- **Recommended Claude Code commit command drops the `CLAUDECODE=` prefix**: Claude Code removed the nested-session check that rejected `claude -p` launched from inside another session, so the workaround is gone. The recommended `[commit.generation]` command shown by `wt config create` no longer carries a leading `CLAUDECODE=`, and `wt` no longer strips `CLAUDECODE` from the environment before running commit-generation commands. ([#2979](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2979))

### Fixed

- **Nushell wrapper installs where Nushell actually autoloads it**: `wt config shell install nu` wrote `wt.nu` to `$nu.default-config-dir/vendor/autoload`, which Nushell never autoloads — on Linux the wrapper was written but silently never loaded, so `wt` was never wrapped (it happened to work on macOS/Windows by coincidence of path layout). It now installs to `$nu.vendor-autoload-dirs | last`, and install/uninstall clean up any worktrunk wrapper stranded at the old location. ([#2992](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2992), thanks @nnutter for reporting)

- **Claude Code hooks work for Fish shell users**: The plugin's hook commands used `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` brace syntax, which Fish doesn't expand; they now use `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, so the activity and worktree-lifecycle hooks fire correctly under Fish. ([#2962](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2962), thanks @amw)

- **Pager no longer wedges the terminal on Ctrl-C (Windows)**: Interrupting the `--help` pager (`less`) with Ctrl-C on Windows could leave the terminal in a broken state; `less` now quits cleanly on interrupt. ([#2969](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2969), thanks @ofek for reporting)

- **Clearer error when the default branch has no commits**: In a freshly initialized repo whose default branch is unborn, `merge`/`rebase`/`squash`/`push` (and the diff report) failed with `Default branch main does not exist locally` plus a misleading hint to reset the cached value. They now report that the branch has no commits yet, without the wrong cache-reset suggestion. ([#2990](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2990))

- **`diagnostic.md` uploads as a gist again**: The `-vv` diagnostic report inlined raw NUL bytes from NUL-separated git output, so `gh gist create` rejected it as a binary file. Control bytes in the subprocess preview are now escaped. ([#2991](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2991))

- **`wt list` tolerates a missing index file**: A repo with no `<gitdir>/index` (nothing ever staged) made the temp-index probe fail; a missing index is now treated as an empty one, matching git's own behavior. ([#2884](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2884))

- **Inline code renders in `--help` section headings**: Terminal `--help` showed literal backticks in headings authored with inline code (e.g. the `wt config state logs` heading `Command log (`commands.jsonl`)`). Headings now reduce inline code to plain text under the heading's uniform style. The `--stage`/`--dry-run` subsection headings in `wt step commit`/`squash` were also renamed to sentence case ("Staging", "Dry run"). ([#3003](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3003))

### Documentation

- **`wt switch` docs give forge PR/MR URLs equal billing with `pr:`/`mr:`**: The switch docs now present the full forge-URL form alongside the `pr:N` shortcut. ([#2970](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2970))

- **New FAQ entry on moving uncommitted changes to a new worktree**. ([#3002](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3002))

### Internal

- **Bare-repo prompt opt-out stored as a hint**: `worktrunk.skip-bare-repo-prompt` moved under the `worktrunk.hints.` namespace, so it now lists under `wt config state hints` and clears with `wt config state clear` (previously a top-level key that escaped both). Clean cutover: users who already opted out are re-prompted once on their next `wt switch --create` in a dotted-name bare repo. ([#3001](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/3001))

## 0.56.0

### Improved

- **`wt list` JSON output includes `repo_url`**: Each item now carries `repo_url`, the repository's web URL derived from the primary remote (absent when there's no parseable forge remote). It's the local checkout's repo — distinct from `ci.repo_url`, which is the repo a PR/MR targets. ([#2941](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2941), thanks @bendrucker)

### Fixed

- **Bare-repo prompts**: Two UX fixes. `wt config create --project` run in a bare repo with no linked worktrees now explains the next step (`wt switch <branch>` first, then create from inside the worktree) instead of failing with a generic "no worktree found". And the bare-repo worktree-path prompt no longer fires for symbolic identifiers (`-`, `@`, `^`, `pr:`/`mr:`), where the example paths would be misleading — it waits for the next switch to a concrete branch name. ([#2951](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2951), thanks @ammachado)

- **Context gauge spacing in the Claude Code statusline**: The context-gauge moon emoji rendered flush against the percent (`🌕42%`). Most terminals draw the emoji double-width and bleed it into the next cell, so the moon collided with the digits; it now carries a trailing space (`🌕 42%`). ([#2944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2944))

- **Console storm on Windows**: Detached background hook processes were created with `DETACHED_PROCESS`, which could flash a burst of console windows. They now use `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` and spawn fully hidden. ([#2959](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2959), thanks @nathanbabcock)

### Documentation

- **Codex commit-generation model bumped to `gpt-5.4-mini`**: The recommended `[commit.generation]` command for Codex — shown by `wt config create` and in the LLM-commits docs — now uses `gpt-5.4-mini` (was `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`). ([#2949](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2949))

### Internal

- **Config-deprecation layer refactor**: The deprecation detector now returns a `Vec<DeprecationKind>` instead of a struct of per-field flags, and the per-section config-table walks collapse into two combinators. Behavior-neutral — warning text and migration output are byte-for-byte unchanged. ([#2946](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2946))

## 0.55.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch` accepts forge PR/MR URLs**: `wt switch https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123` now resolves the same way as `wt switch pr:123`, and the URL form works anywhere a `pr:N` / `mr:N` shortcut does (positional argument and `--base`). Detection is shape-based, not host-based — any `http(s)://` URL whose path contains `/pull/N`, `/pulls/N`, `/-/merge_requests/N`, or `/pullrequest/N` matches, covering GitHub (including Enterprise), GitLab, Gitea, and Azure DevOps, including self-hosted instances. ([#2898](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2898), thanks @thiagowfx for the request)

- **`-vv` startup pointer names `diagnostic.md`**: The `-vv` pointer now lists the shared log directory once with all three files it will contain — `trace.log`, `subprocess.log`, and `diagnostic.md` — so the diagnostic bundle is discoverable at startup rather than only when the gist hint fires at exit. The pointer verb reads `Writing to …` instead of `Tracing to …`. ([#2919](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2919))

### Fixed

- **Claude Code plugin keeps unmerged branches during worktree cleanup**: The plugin's `WorktreeRemove` hook passed `-D` (`--force-delete`) to `wt remove`, which removes a branch even when it carries commits that aren't merged or pushed. The hook now uses the default removal: a merged or integrated branch is removed cleanly, while one with unmerged commits is kept, with a `wt remove -D <branch>` hint for deleting it deliberately. ([#2940](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2940), thanks @jbeda for reporting)

- **`wt list` and `wt step prune` degrade gracefully on unborn worktrees**: A linked worktree created with `git worktree add --orphan` sits on an unborn branch whose `HEAD` is the null OID. `wt list` used to show `working-tree-diff (fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD')` and a merge-tree error in its columns, and `wt step prune` aborted its entire scan with `fatal: Needed a single revision`, blocking pruning of every other worktree. Both now treat an unborn worktree as having no commits: `wt list` renders `·` for the commit-dependent columns, and `wt step prune` skips it (as it does locked worktrees) and continues. ([#2937](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2937), thanks @nedtwigg for reporting)

### Documentation

- **Doc-site and `--help` prose cleanup**: A writing-prose pass across the FAQ, config, list, remove, Claude Code, hook, LLM-commits, and Tips & Patterns pages (some via `--help` text in `after_long_help`). ([#2922](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2922), [#2925](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2925))

### Internal

- **Collapsed duplicated code paths and removed dead code left by completed cut-overs**: A net reduction across the shell, git, and command layers. ([#2931](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2931), [#2932](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2932), [#2934](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2934))

## 0.54.0

### Improved

- **Rate-limit pace segment in the Claude Code statusline**: `wt list statusline --format=claude-code` now surfaces a yellow `1.3×pace(10am–3pm)` segment when Claude Code's reported five-hour or seven-day rate-limit window is on track to be hit before its reset. The segment uses a Bayesian forecast on `P(final ≥ 100%)` so early-window bursts (e.g., 5% used at 3% elapsed) don't trigger spurious warnings — only the worse-projected of the two windows is shown, and the segment is hidden entirely when both are safe. The clock format inside the parentheses honors `LC_ALL` / `LC_TIME` / `LANG`: `en_US`/`en_PH`/`en_CA` get 12-hour (`10am–3pm`), everything else (including unset and `C`/`POSIX`) gets 24-hour (`10:00–15:00`). ([#2899](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2899), [#2911](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2911))

- **`wt step prune` streams removals and never prompts mid-scan**: Prune now bundles integration, removability, and age checks into a single parallel pass and starts removing candidates as soon as they qualify, instead of batching the scan and acting at the end. Dirty / locked / primary worktrees drop out before the age check, so a young + dirty + integrated worktree no longer surfaces as `Skipped (younger than 1d)` — the `(younger than X)` message now fires only when the worktree would actually have been pruned. With `--yes`, every project command is auto-approved as before; without `--yes`, a candidate whose hooks include an unapproved project command is SKIPPED with `(approval required)` rather than aborting the scan with an inline prompt the streaming structure couldn't accommodate. The end-of-run hint enumerates the unapproved hook templates from the invoking worktree's config and emits one copy-pasteable `wt -C <path> remove` line per skipped candidate, annotating candidates whose own `.config/wt.toml` differs from the invoking worktree's. ([#2908](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2908), [#2910](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2910))

- **`wt step prune` default `--min-age` raised from 1h to 1d**: A worktree just created from the default branch looks "merged" because its branch still points at the same commit; a one-day floor keeps an unattended prune from sweeping it up before its owner starts work. Explicit `--min-age=0s` or any other value is unchanged. ([#2886](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2886))

- **Legacy shell-wrapper deprecation warning**: Users who upgrade `wt` without restarting their shell still run the previous release's wrapper, which sets only `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_FILE` instead of the new split `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_CD_FILE` / `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_EXEC_FILE` pair. That fallback used to be silent; `wt` now emits a one-shot per-process warning hinting at `wt config shell install`. bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell pick up the new wrapper on the next shell restart; nushell is the one shell where users must rerun `wt config shell install nu` because its wrapper is a static file. ([#2880](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2880))

- **`-vv` no longer floods stderr; raw subprocess sink renamed to `subprocess.log`**: A `-vv` invocation used to spray ~15K lines of stderr per command, forcing a redirect to a file even though `trace.log` already mirrored most of it. The debug-level `log::*` pipeline now writes to `.git/wt/logs/trace.log` at `-vv`; Info-level records (hook output, template expansions, the `Writing to …` pointer) stay on stderr at every verbosity level. The companion raw-subprocess-bytes file is renamed from `output.log` to `subprocess.log` — the prior name read as "stuff `wt` printed" but actually held uncapped multi-MB subprocess bodies (`git log -p`, patch-id pipelines). `RUST_LOG` is now honored at every verbosity level: `wt -v` and `wt -vv` previously hardcoded Info / Debug and silently dropped any `RUST_LOG` directive (`RUST_LOG=trace wt -vv` was capped at Debug, `RUST_LOG=worktrunk=trace wt -v` was ignored); all three levels now flow through one builder shape with `RUST_LOG` layered on top of the flag baseline. ([#2892](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2892), [#2901](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2901), [#2913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2913))

### Fixed

- **Data-safety across the worktree merge / remove / prune lifecycle**: Five TOCTOU and scoping fixes. `wt merge` and `wt remove` revalidate cleanliness and branch integration *after* `pre-remove` hooks run, so a hook (or concurrent process) that dirties the worktree or advances the branch can no longer trash the directory or trigger `git branch -D` against the stale pre-hook decision. The background-removal path does the same revalidation and fails closed for submodule worktrees on the fallback path instead of forcing. `wt step prune` runs its rename-failure fallback `git branch -d` synchronously under the write guard for non-current worktrees (no more race against live integration readers on `.git/config`), scopes hook approval to the worktrees it will actually remove (an unrelated unapproved hook can no longer abort a non-interactive prune), and prunes the stale metadata of detached worktrees whose directory was deleted outside Worktrunk. ([#2870](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2870))

### Documentation

- **`-v` / `-vv` help and FAQ**: The `-v` help text is split out from its 150-character parenthetical, and `docs/content/faq.md` gains a "What does `-v` / `-vv` do?" section with a three-level table. ([#2913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2913))

- **Hook docs and `pre-start` docstring**: The `pre_create` field docstring in `HooksConfig` (user-visible via generated JSON schema) read "Commands to execute before worktree creation"; `pre-start` actually runs *after* worktree creation, blocking. Restored the correct wording. The `docs/content/extending.md` overview is reworked to read more cleanly: parallel three-paragraph intro for hooks / aliases / custom subcommands, fewer em-dashes, and the Reference section's table no longer duplicates content covered in prose. ([#2879](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2879), [#2912](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2912))

### Internal

- **Migrated logging from `env_logger` to `tracing-subscriber`**: A layered subscriber routes records structurally by target and verbosity. Existing `log::*` callers are bridged into `tracing` via `tracing_log::LogTracer`. `[wt-trace]` records emit as typed structured fields with a single formatter rendering the wire shape, so the grammar lives in one place instead of being duplicated across every emit site.

- **`UncommittedChanges` error renders dirty files in the canonical gutter**, matching `ConflictingChanges` and the project's `format_with_gutter()` convention. ([#2887](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2887))

## 0.53.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch --execute` deprecates shell command lines**: A future release will switch `--execute` (`-x`) to an argv input model — a single program, with arguments after `--`, run with no implicit shell. This release is the warn phase: `-x` now warns when its value is a shell command line, multiple words, or template markup, and the hint shows a copy-pasteable migration (`--execute sh -- -c '…'`) plus a link to comment on the cutover if the new form would regress a workflow. A single program name stays silent. ([#2852](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2852), [#2863](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2863))

- **`wt config show` reports the project identifier**: The PROJECT CONFIG section now prints the project identifier (`<host>/<owner>/<repo>` from the primary remote, or the canonical repo path), so you can find the key for a `[projects."…"]` block in your user config without deriving it by hand. `wt config show --format=json` gains a matching `identifier` field. Closes [#2826](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2826). ([#2827](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2827), thanks @airtonix for the request)

- **Gemini CLI extension detection**: `wt config show` now renders a GEMINI CLI section reporting whether the worktrunk Gemini extension is installed. The agent-integration docs gained install instructions for OpenCode and Gemini CLI alongside Claude Code and Codex. ([#2819](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2819))

- **`pre-create`/`post-create` hook aliases**: The worktree-creation hooks `pre-start`/`post-start` now also accept `pre-create`/`post-create` as silent aliases — in config (top-level, `[hooks.*]`, and per-project sections, in string, table, and array-of-tables form) and on the `wt hook` command line. Docs continue to recommend `pre-start`/`post-start`; the canonical names may switch in a later release. Full plan: [#2838](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2838). ([#2840](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2840), [#2857](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2857))

### Fixed

- **Hooks resolve project config from the invoking worktree**: Worktrunk resolved each hook's `.config/wt.toml` from a different worktree depending on the hook, and `wt switch --create` read the base ref's _committed_ config via `git show` — so an uncommitted or branch-local `.config/wt.toml` silently failed to fire creation hooks, and `wt config show` disagreed with what actually ran. Every hook now resolves its commands from the `.config/wt.toml` of the worktree `wt` ran in — the same file `wt config show` displays. In the common case of a committed, repo-wide config this is unchanged; it diverges only when a branch carries its own working-tree edits. Fixes [#2856](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2856) and [#2818](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2818). ([#2873](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2873), thanks @Oxygen66 and @sirianni for reporting)

- **Picker prompts for approval before running project `pre-switch` hooks**: Selecting a worktree in the interactive picker (`wt switch` with no argument) ran a project-defined `pre-switch` hook from `.config/wt.toml` without the approval prompt that gates every other hook — unapproved code from a freshly cloned repo executing silently. The picker now routes `pre-switch` hooks through the same approval gate as `wt switch <branch>` and as its own `post-switch`/`pre-start`/`post-start` hooks. ([#2858](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2858))

- **Interactive picker switches with `cd = false`**: With `[switch] cd = false` (or `wt switch --no-cd`), opening the picker (`wt switch` with no branch argument) and selecting a worktree printed the branch name and exited — no switch, no hooks, and `Alt-c` created nothing. The picker now runs the same switch pipeline as `wt switch <branch>`, suppressing only the cd directive: `pre-switch`/`post-switch` hooks fire and `Alt-c` creates the worktree. `--format=json` works in the picker too, and replaces the old print-only output for scripting — it both switches and prints a structured result (`action`, `branch`, `path`) to stdout. ([#2845](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2845), thanks @endigma for the discussion in [#2837](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2837))

- **`alt-r` in the picker removes the right worktree**: The interactive picker identified each row by branch name for its `alt-r` removal signal; detached worktrees all report `(detached)`, so two detached rows collided and `alt-r` could remove the wrong worktree. Rows backed by a worktree now carry a unique path-based identity. ([#2866](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2866))

- **`--clobber` backs up blocked paths atomically**: `wt switch --clobber` and `wt step relocate --clobber` back up a path blocking the target before clobbering it. Both used an `exists()` check followed by `std::fs::rename`, which silently overwrites an existing destination — a time-of-check/time-of-use race that could destroy a just-created backup. They now share one helper that moves the blocker with an atomic no-overwrite rename and counts up through `-2`, `-3`, … suffixes on a name collision instead of failing. (`wt step relocate`'s backup name changes from `.bak-<timestamp>` to the extension-aware `.bak.<timestamp>` form.) ([#2849](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2849), [#2865](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2865))

- **Squash-merge detection ignores `diff.*` git config**: Worktrunk's squash-merge integration check compared `git patch-id` hashes computed from two different diff generators — one plumbing (ignores `diff.*` config), one porcelain (honors it). For anyone with a non-default `diff.context` or `diff.algorithm`, the two never agreed, so a genuinely squash-merged branch was reported as not integrated — breaking `wt remove` ("Branch unmerged"), the `wt list` integration symbol, and `wt step prune`. Both sides now use plumbing, immune to every `diff.*` setting. ([#2821](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2821))

- **Wedged and orphaned fsmonitor daemons are reaped**: With `core.fsmonitor=true`, git runs a per-worktree `git fsmonitor--daemon`; a wedged one stops answering its IPC socket — which hangs `git status` and `wt list` — and ignores the `stop` request `wt remove` sends, so it leaks once its worktree is gone (dozens can accumulate). `wt remove` now resolves the daemon's PID from its IPC socket and force-terminates it (SIGTERM, brief wait, SIGKILL) when `stop` doesn't take, and its background internal sweep additionally reaps any daemon whose socket no longer resolves to a live worktree — covering daemons orphaned by `git worktree remove`, a manual `rm`, or a crashed `wt`. A daemon serving a live worktree is never reaped. ([#2813](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2813), [#2814](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2814))

- **Config migration no longer silently drops deprecated config**: A deprecated section (`[commit-generation]`, `[select]`, …) was discarded without writing its canonical replacement when the canonical key already existed as a scalar or an inline-table value — real data loss, now fixed for both shapes. Deprecated template variables are rewritten only inside `{{ }}`/`{% %}` tags, so literal command text and `{% set %}` locals are left intact. System config now passes through the same deprecation-warning gate as user config. ([#2788](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2788), [#2851](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2851))

- **Hook filtering and the command-approval store are hardened**: `--only project:deploy user:lint` matched filter names across the project/user split, so a name given for one source could select an unintended hook from the other; the approval gate and executor now share one source-scoped predicate. Template variables are detected by parsing the template rather than substring matching (`{{ vars["env"] }}` and bare `{{ vars }}` were missed), and an undefined variable in a `{% if %}` predicate is now a clear error instead of being silently ignored. The approvals trust store is written atomically, rejects unknown keys instead of silently dropping approvals, and its migration is locked and validated before it runs. ([#2841](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2841))

- **`wt` no longer panics on non-UTF-8 arguments**, and `--format` passed to a config-state write action now reports the conflict through normal error handling instead of exiting before diagnostics and output run. ([#2788](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2788))

- **Picker, `wt switch`, and statusline correctness**: The picker now plans each `alt-r` removal against fresh repository state rather than a cache left stale by the previous removal. `wt switch` prefers an exact local branch over stripping a remote prefix (a local branch literally named `origin/foo` was retargeted), and fails closed on a malformed `forge.platform` instead of silently falling back to GitHub. A single-row statusline skips the repo-wide ahead/behind scan, a speedup on large repositories. ([#2842](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2842))

- **Shell-correct escaping for the `--execute` payload**: `wt switch -x` builds its payload as a shell-escaped string evaluated by the active shell wrapper. POSIX single-quote escaping was applied unconditionally, but PowerShell (`Invoke-Expression`) and fish (`eval`) don't share POSIX quoting — under fish a backslash in the payload was silently dropped and a trailing backslash aborted evaluation, and under PowerShell the `'\''` idiom is invalid. Escaping now keys on the active directive shell. Separately, every other `shell_escape` call site is pinned to POSIX escaping rather than the crate's platform-sensitive entry point, which on Windows could pick cmd-style quoting that mis-escapes arguments spliced into a POSIX shell. ([#2843](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2843), [#2815](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2815))

- **`wt hook show` lists per-project user hooks**: `wt hook show` displayed only global user hooks, omitting per-project hooks defined under `[projects."…"]` in the user config; it now merges both, matching what actually runs. ([#2844](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2844))

- **Statusline reserves a fixed margin instead of 20% of width**: When `wt list statusline` runs as a Claude Code subprocess it can't detect the terminal directly and walks the process tree for a TTY; that fallback reserved 20% of the detected width for Claude Code's own UI, giving up 40 columns on a 200-column terminal. It now reserves a fixed 5 columns. ([#2871](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2871))

- **User-output consistency**: An audit against the project's output conventions corrected six messages — state-acknowledging messages ("All shells already configured", the version-check "Up to date") use the info marker rather than success; the `wt step relocate` summary keys its message type on whether anything was relocated; "Diagnostic saved" reports as a success with the `@`-path convention; and a stray trailing period and a cross-message pronoun were removed. ([#2867](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2867))

- **Repo-wide internal hook logs are written as top-level files**: Branch-agnostic internal-operation logs were written into a top-level `internal/` directory, which `wt config state` then misclassified as a branch; they now write to `internal-{op}.log` files alongside the other shared logs. ([#2851](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2851))

- **Nix flake includes `gemini-extension.json`**: The flake's source filter omitted `gemini-extension.json`, so a Nix build produced a package missing the Gemini CLI extension manifest. ([#2834](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2834))

### Documentation

- **`wt remove --force` help and FAQ**: Both said `--force` overrides the untracked-files check "for build artifacts"; `--force` actually discards staged and modified _tracked_ files too. The help text and FAQ now state that `--force` discards staged, modified, and untracked files. ([#2869](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2869))

- **cmux recipe**: Re-added a verified cmux integration recipe to Tips & Patterns. ([#2836](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2836), thanks @endigma for the verified config)

## 0.52.0

### Improved

- **`wt step tether`**: New `[experimental]` operation that runs a command in its own process group and kills the whole group when the command exits or its worktree is removed (a 250ms portable poll — `killpg` on Unix, `taskkill /T /F` on Windows). A single `post-start` hook (`wt step tether -- npm run dev`) replaces the usual `post-start`-to-launch / `pre-remove`-to-stop pair, and unlike `pre-remove` it also cleans up after a `git worktree remove`, an `rm -rf`, or a crashed hook — the leak path that eventually saturates macOS `fseventsd`. Arguments after `--` run directly with no shell, matching `wt step for-each`. ([#2785](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2785))

- **Gemini CLI extension**: Worktrunk now ships a Gemini CLI extension for `wt list` activity tracking, installable with `gemini extensions install max-sixty/worktrunk`. The extension's manifest, hooks, and skills resolve at the repo root, so the GitHub-name install path works without a local clone. ([#2803](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2803), [#2807](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2807), thanks @rafavital for the request in [#2763](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2763))

### Fixed

- **Project hooks are frozen at the approval gate**: A project-defined `pre-*`/`post-*` hook command was selected from `.config/wt.toml` twice — once to build the approval prompt, once at execution — and the operation itself mutates state between the two reads (a merge moves the target ref, an auto-rebase rewrites the feature config, a removal scrubs the worktree, `git worktree add` materializes a `--create` worktree). The second read could select a command the user never approved; on a freshly cloned repo that is unapproved code execution. The gate now freezes the command set into an immutable plan that the executor consumes verbatim, so post-operation hooks can never run an unapproved command. Behavior is otherwise unchanged, and `wt merge --no-hooks` (or a declined/empty plan) now returns before loading approvals, so a malformed `approvals.toml` no longer aborts a command that had nothing to authorize. ([#2806](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2806))

- **Declining the `wt merge` commit-append no longer skips hooks**: When a project's `pre-merge`/`post-merge` hooks were already approved, `wt merge` bundled the commit-message append into the same prompt; declining the lone append prompt skipped every hook for that run even though the user only meant to skip the append. The append is now gated on its own path (the same one `wt step commit`/`wt step squash` use), so declining it drops only the append. On a fresh repo where both the hooks and the append are unapproved this is now two prompts instead of one bundled prompt. Decline messages are also canonicalized across `merge`, `remove`, `prune`, and `switch` (`Commands declined, … without hooks`). ([#2802](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2802))

- **Windows `wt step prune` `.git/config` race**: `wt step prune` could intermittently fail on Windows with `unable to access '.git/config': Permission denied` — its parallel branch-integration checks read `.git/config` while an inline `git branch -D` rewrote it via git's lockfile rename, which on Windows briefly blocks concurrent readers. Branch-integration reads are now excluded from overlapping the `git branch -D` that rewrites config. ([#2808](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2808))

## 0.51.0

### Improved

- **Codex support**: Worktrunk now ships a first-class Codex plugin alongside the Claude Code one. `wt config plugins codex install` installs it; `wt config show --full` reports its state. The Codex plugin bundles the shared configuration skill — documentation the agent reads to help set up LLM commits, hooks, and troubleshooting. Codex exposes no turn-end or worktree-lifecycle hooks, so unlike Claude Code it has no `wt list` activity tracking or session worktree isolation; the skill is the integration. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/claude-code/) ([#2512](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2512), thanks @douglas; [#2780](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2780), [#2782](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2782), [#2786](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2786))

- **Experimental project-level commit-message guidance**: `[commit.generation] template-append` adds to the commit/squash LLM prompt instead of replacing it (`template` still replaces), and is now valid in both user config and project `.config/wt.toml`. The user fragment renders into a `<user-guidance>` block (no approval); the project fragment renders into a gated `<project-guidance>` block bundled into the existing `wt merge` hook-approval prompt — declining is non-fatal. User-only commit-generation keys placed in project config still get the "this belongs in user config" redirect. ([#2774](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2774), [#2790](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2790), thanks @gabimoncha for the request in [#2758](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2758))

- **`/wt-switch-create` takes an optional repo and a `--` task delimiter**: The Claude Code skill now accepts `<branch> [<repo>] [-- <task>]`. The optional second token names a different repository to create the worktree in; `--` cleanly separates the task from the rest. Without a `--`, a path-shaped second token is treated as the repo and the remainder as the task. ([#2751](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2751))

- **`wt list --full` and `wt statusline` count untracked files in `HEAD±`**: The `HEAD±` working-diff segment now includes untracked-file lines under `--full` and in `wt statusline`, matching `wt step diff`. Default `wt list` and the picker stay on the cheap tracked-only path. ([#2764](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2764))

- **`wt step prune` and `wt list` no longer stall on long-divergent branches**: The patch-id squash-merge scan (`is_squash_merged_via_patch_id`) ran `git log -p` over the entire target-side history — tens of thousands of commits on a fast-moving repo, taking seconds to tens of seconds. It's now capped at 500 commits via a cheap graph-only pre-flight; above the cap the check returns "not squash-merged" (the safe answer). ([#2752](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2752))

### Fixed

- **Config deprecation-layer correctness**: Three independent fixes — structural migration now preserves unrelated `[ci]` keys and unparsable deprecated sections instead of discarding them; `config update` aborts on an approvals-copy I/O failure instead of silently dropping approvals; deprecated template-variable renaming rewrites the parsed TOML tree instead of doing a raw text replace that corrupted occurrences inside escaped strings. ([#2783](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2783))

- **Data-safety and correctness fixes**: Six independent single-file fixes — `wt step relocate --clobber` refuses to overwrite an existing backup; `wt remove` re-checks cleanliness immediately before a forced submodule removal (time-of-check/time-of-use); `wt switch` re-discovers the base worktree via a fresh `Repository` after `worktree add` instead of reading a stale cached list; `wt switch pr:<N>` derives owner/repo from the forge remote rather than the primary remote and validates an empty Azure source branch at the provider boundary; user-controllable branch operands are guarded with `--`. ([#2784](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2784))

### Documentation

- **Alias template timing**: A new Aliases subsection documents that templates render at alias dispatch using the invoking worktree's context, so a nested `wt` command's own template variables resolve against the outer worktree unless wrapped in `{% raw %}…{% endraw %}`. Fixes [#2753](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2753). (thanks @viicslen for reporting) ([#2754](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2754))

### Internal

- The Claude Code and Codex plugin payloads are consolidated into one shared directory. ([#2789](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2789))
- `WORKTRUNK_BOT_TOKEN` is renamed to `TEND_BOT_TOKEN` in non-tend CI workflows. ([#2781](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2781))

## 0.50.0

### Improved

- **Experimental Azure DevOps support**: `wt switch pr:<N>` resolves Azure DevOps pull requests via the `az` CLI — auto-detected from `dev.azure.com` / `ssh.dev.azure.com` / `*.visualstudio.com` remotes, or pinned with `[forge] platform = "azure-devops"`. `wt list --full` surfaces Azure DevOps PR and pipeline CI status, and `wt config show --full` reports `az` install/auth state when Azure DevOps is the detected platform. Requires the `azure-devops` CLI extension. GitHub still wins in mixed-remote setups. ([#1256](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1256), thanks @mikeyroush; thanks @dlecan for [#1144](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1144))

- **Experimental Gitea support extended to `wt list` and `wt config show`**: `wt switch pr:<N>` already resolved Gitea PRs via the `tea` CLI; `wt list --full` and `wt config show --full` now recognize Gitea repos too — `wt list --full` shows a CI indicator (open-PR conflicts plus the PR head commit's combined status, falling back to the branch's latest status when no PR exists) linked to the PR, and `wt config show --full` reports `tea` install/auth state. ([#1320](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1320), thanks @SjB; [#2702](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2702), [#2707](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2707), [#2732](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2732))

- **Hooks resolve project config from the worktree they act on — no primary-worktree fallback**: Previously `pre-remove` read the *primary* worktree's `.config/wt.toml` rather than the worktree being removed, and `post-remove` / `post-switch` read the post-removal working directory's config, so a `pre-remove` (or `post-remove`) you added on a feature branch never fired when removing that branch's worktree. Now every hook reads the `.config/wt.toml` of the worktree it acts on — `pre-remove` / `post-remove` read the removed worktree's config (snapshotted before removal), `post-switch` reads the destination worktree's — and the approval prompt collects hook commands from that same worktree, so a branch-local `pre-remove` always appears in the prompt before it runs. A worktree with no `.config/wt.toml` runs no project hooks; a present-but-malformed config aborts the operation with the parse error instead of silently using the primary's. (Breaking: removing a worktree no longer runs the primary worktree's `pre-remove` / `post-remove` hooks unless they're also defined in the removed worktree's `.config/wt.toml`. For an existing worktree that predates a hook added on the default branch, copy the hook into that worktree's `.config/wt.toml` to restore the previous behavior; new worktrees branched off the default branch pick it up as before.) ([#2690](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2690), [#2703](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2703), [#2714](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2714), [#2717](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2717), [#2701](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2701), [#2708](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2708), [#2727](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2727), [#2736](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2736), [#2748](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2748))

- **`wt config alias show` with no name lists every alias**: `wt config alias show <name>` shows one alias's full definition; with no name it now prints that same `○ Alias <name> (<source>):` block for every configured alias, in name order. `wt --help` (and `wt step --help`) drop the inline aliases table for a compact names-only list that points here. ([#2684](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2684), [#2691](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2691), [#2688](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2688))

- **`wt switch` picker validates hook templates before creating the worktree**: Creating a branch from the picker (Alt-C) now runs the same template pre-flight that `wt switch --create` does, so a project config with a broken hook template (syntax error, undefined variable) fails before `git worktree add` instead of after — no orphaned worktree left blocking a re-run with the same name. ([#2712](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2712))

- **`wt list --branches` skips a serial graph walk on warm runs**: Branch ahead/behind counts for the `main↕` and `Remote⇅` columns are now cached SHA-keyed, so a warm `wt list --branches` no longer pays the single-threaded `git for-each-ref --format='%(ahead-behind:…)'` walk that ran before the parallel task pool opened — on a large repo (rust-lang/rust) that walk was ~40% of `wt list`'s wall time. The push-remote URL is cached and the local-branch scan is shared with `capture_refs`, removing two more duplicate `for-each-ref` invocations per render. ([#2704](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2704), [#2718](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2718), [#2673](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2673))

- **Claude Code plugin ships the `wt-switch-create` skill**: Installing the worktrunk Claude Code plugin now provides `/wt-switch-create <branch> [task]`, which calls `EnterWorktree` to create (or re-enter — it's idempotent) a worktree in worktrunk's sibling layout (`<repo>.<branch>/`) and re-roots the current Claude session into it; anything after the branch name runs as the task there. ([#2737](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2737), thanks @onetom for [#2631](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2631))

- **Paths in warning messages are bold**: Config-file-not-found, the legacy-fish-config removal warning, completions-not-configured, and outdated-shell-extension warnings now bold the path they mention, matching the convention used elsewhere. ([#2677](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2677))

### Fixed

- **Ctrl-C against a concurrent alias reports exit code 130, not 143**: `wt step <concurrent-alias>` interrupted by Ctrl-C could exit with 143 (SIGTERM) instead of 130 (SIGINT) when, under load, wt's SIGINT→SIGTERM escalation timer (200ms) fired before the child finished dying from the SIGINT. wt now records the user's originating signal and reports that as its exit code. ([#2724](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2724))

- **Branch names starting with `-` no longer confuse git**: A branch literally named `-foo` (creatable via `git update-ref refs/heads/-foo HEAD`) could be misparsed as an option by the git subcommands wt invokes — most visibly the hook-approval gate `wt switch` runs before creating a worktree at such a ref, which reads `.config/wt.toml` via `git show <ref>:…`, and `wt step relocate`'s `git worktree add`. User-controllable refs now pass `--end-of-options` (and `--verify` for `rev-parse`) so git treats them as data. ([#2711](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2711), [#2725](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2725), [#2738](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2738))

- **`wt switch` picker's `alt-r` removal no longer runs unapproved project hooks**: The picker's removal path was a parallel reimplementation of `wt remove`'s teardown that ran `pre-remove` / `post-remove` / `post-switch` hooks unconditionally, bypassing the approval gate every other removal path goes through. The picker now routes through the shared `handle_remove_output` (with a `silent` flag for the in-skim case) and consults the existing approval state read-only — unapproved hooks are skipped, approved ones run. Removing the current worktree via `alt-r` also registers `post-switch` hooks against the home worktree now, matching `wt remove` / `wt merge` / `wt step prune`. ([#2746](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2746))

- **Nushell and PowerShell shell-extension label**: `wt config show` and the `--dry-run uninstall` preview labeled Nushell and PowerShell inconsistently; they now read `shell extension & completions` like Bash and Zsh — Fish is the only supported shell whose completions live in a separate file. ([#2699](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2699), [#2705](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2705))

- **Bash hook syntax highlighting no longer corrupts paths**: `format_bash_with_gutter` swapped Jinja `{{ }}` delimiters for internal placeholders that could collide with text in the command (e.g. a Windows tempdir path), splitting it mid-stream in `--help` and snapshot output. The placeholders are now chosen to be collision-free. ([#2722](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2722))

### Internal

- Foreground signal forwarding (Ctrl-C handling for hook pipelines, `wt step for-each`, concurrent alias groups) is unified into one module. ([#2734](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2734))
- `CiPlatform` moved to the library crate and is cached on `RepoCache`; the "override" framing around `[forge] platform` is dropped. The "invalid CI platform in config" warning is also deduplicated to once per `wt list` run instead of firing per branch. ([#2692](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2692), [#2686](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2686))
- The remove-hook approval helper is shared across `wt remove` / `wt merge` / `wt step prune`, and the `for-each-ref` scan primitive is shared with the remote-inventory cache populated from the snapshot path. ([#2709](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2709), [#2735](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2735))
- CI fails the build if tests leave files behind in the working tree; `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` defaults to a temp-dir path when not inherited, keeping coverage runs from dropping `*.profraw` at the repo root. ([#2719](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2719), [#2730](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2730), [#2713](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2713))
- `codename_index` keeps its hash in `u64` before narrowing, so the `codename` filter picks the same word on 32-bit and 64-bit builds (no-op on 64-bit). ([#2667](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2667))

## 0.49.0

### Improved

- **New `codename(n)` template filter**: Produces deterministic friendly names from any input string — `codename(1)` returns a noun, `codename(2)` returns `adjective-noun`, higher counts add more adjectives. The pool is large enough (~1.26M combinations for `codename(2)`) that the result usually stands alone as a worktree leaf, e.g. `worktree-path = "{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | codename(2) }}"`. ([#2641](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2641), thanks @endigma)

- **Picker preview disk cache**: The `wt switch` picker now caches Log, BranchDiff, and UpstreamDiff previews to disk under `.git/wt/cache/picker-preview/`, keyed by SHA + width, so repeat invocations skip the `git log` / `git diff` subprocesses they already paid for. The Log cache splits SHA-deterministic raw output from the dim/bright styling that depends on `main`'s position, and a background refresh worker rewrites stale entries after every disk hit so the next visit sees up-to-date ref decorations. State integration bundles the new cache with the existing git-commands cache for `wt config state get` / `state clear --all`. ([#2628](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2628), [#2646](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2646))

- **Picker fans out fewer `git rev-parse` calls**: `compute_branch_diff_preview` previously forked `git rev-parse <default_branch>` once per item to key its disk cache. A new `Repository::default_branch_sha()` reads the SHA from the already-cached branch inventory, collapsing N redundant subprocesses down to one. ([#2658](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2658))

- **"X has uncommitted changes" errors now list the dirty files**: `GitError::UncommittedChanges` carries the porcelain lines from `git status` and the renderer prints them between the title and hint, so users hitting the error on `wt remove`, `wt merge` cleanup, `wt step promote`, or `wt merge --no-commit` see exactly what's blocking without re-running `git status`. No new git subprocesses — `is_dirty()` was already running `git status --porcelain` and discarding the output. (Breaking: `GitError::UncommittedChanges` gained a `dirty_files: Vec<String>` field.) ([#2653](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2653))

### Fixed

- **`wt switch` integrates with `cd` aliases like zoxide**: Previously the shell wrapper invoked the `cd` shell function directly, so users with `cd` aliased to `__zoxide_z` or similar saw `zoxide: no match found` when switching to a fresh worktree. The bash and zsh wrappers now use `builtin cd` to bypass the alias. Fixes [#2643](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2643). ([#2644](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2644), thanks @xkumiyu for reporting)

- **Empty hook tables no longer panic during `wt switch --create`**: A config like `[post-start]` with no entries below it would crash the background `HookAnnouncer` path. The config layer now treats an empty hook table as zero steps. Fixes [#2634](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2634). ([#2635](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2635), thanks @topit for reporting)

- **`Repository` accessors no longer leak the process CWD**: `Repository::current_worktree()` resolved against the global CWD instead of the Repository's own discovery path, so callers using `Repository::at(p)` (output handlers, picker, recovery, tests) silently got a `WorkingTree` at the *process CWD* rather than at `p`. Five sibling sites had the same bug — `project_config_path`, `project_config`, `require_current_branch`, `resolve_worktree_name("@")`, `resolve_worktree("@")`. Fixed at the helper itself, replacing PR #2625's per-site workaround. ([#2652](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2652))

- **`WorkingTree::is_linked` tolerates non-git CWDs**: When wt's process CWD was outside any git repo (e.g. the Nix build sandbox), `infer_default_branch_locally` would error out trying to call `is_linked` on a non-git path. The check now returns `false` instead. Fixes [#2624](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2624). ([#2625](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2625), thanks @DArtagan for reporting)

- **Picker no longer overlays warnings on the active TUI**: Warnings emitted by `collect::collect` (stale default branch, batch-fetch failure, drain timeout) used to print to stderr from a background thread while skim's TUI owned the terminal, corrupting the rendered frame and leaving fragments visible after the user picked. Warnings now stash through the picker and drain to stderr after skim releases the terminal. The drain-timeout warning is also subcommand-agnostic instead of hardcoding `wt list`. ([#2627](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2627))

- **Picker clears its frame on exit in inline mode**: On some Linux terminals the picker's rows remained visible after pressing Enter because skim emitted an unmatched `rmcup` (alternate-screen toggle) instead of an explicit erase. Setting skim's `no_clear_start` option forces the explicit erase path. ([#2626](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2626))

- **Failed `git log` no longer poisons the picker's preview disk cache**: When the underlying `git log` subprocess errored, the picker still wrote the error string into the preview cache, so the next read served the stale failure instead of retrying. The write is now skipped on failure. ([#2651](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2651))

- **`wt step prune` says "removing branch" for branch-only candidates**: The error context wrapping every `try_remove` call was hardcoded to "removing worktree for X", which misled users when prune was actually removing an orphan branch with no worktree attached. ([#2619](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2619))

- **Claude Code Windows integration uses a cross-platform wrapper**: The plugin's `wt` invocation collided with Windows Terminal's built-in `wt.exe` alias, opening Windows Terminal windows instead of running the wt CLI. A new `wt.sh` wrapper script tries the standard Worktrunk binary names (`wt`, `git-wt`) and dispatches to the right one across pwsh, Git Bash, and WSL. ([#1754](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1754), thanks @lucaspimentel)

- **`wt config plugins opencode install` writes to `~/.config/opencode/` on macOS**: The install path fell through to `dirs::config_dir()`, which resolves to `~/Library/Application Support/opencode/` on macOS — but that's OpenCode's *managed* settings directory; user plugins belong under `~/.config/opencode/`. The path now follows OpenCode's documented precedence: `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode > ~/.config/opencode`. Linux behavior is unchanged. Fixes [#2654](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2654). ([#2655](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2655), thanks @gwenwindflower for reporting)

### Documentation

- **cmux workspace integration recipe**: Adds cmux to the *Agent handoffs* section and documents a per-worktree workspace recipe with create/select/close lifecycle hooks. Includes the key gotcha — cmux's socket restricts access to processes with cmux terminal ancestry, so `pre-*` hooks must be used instead of `post-*`. ([#1907](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1907), thanks @alvistar)

### Internal

- Consolidated slow CI checks (Nix flake build, Windows long-tail) onto a `nightly` workflow triggered by a `nightly` PR label, keeping the PR-blocking suite faster. ([#2630](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2630), [#2636](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2636), [#2645](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2645), [#2647](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2647), [#2648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2648))
- `cargo-affected` now uploads its `report.json` as a build artifact for downstream tooling. ([#2621](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2621))
- Test isolation hardening: `wt_command()` defaults to an isolated tempdir so tests no longer inherit the process CWD, and the `current_or_recover` test was decoupled from the inherited CWD. ([#2642](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2642), [#2649](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2649))

## 0.48.0

### Improved

- **`--format=json` extends to seven more commands**: `wt step rebase`, `wt step push`, `wt step commit`, `wt step squash`, `wt step relocate`, `wt step copy-ignored`, and `wt hook show` now accept `--format=json`. Shapes follow the existing pattern (additive on stdout; human prose stays on stderr) and use stable snake_case `outcome` discriminators where the result has multiple variants. ([#2560](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2560))

- **`wt step commit` and `wt step squash` gain `--dry-run`**: Renders the prompt, prints the shell invocation that would call the LLM, calls the LLM and prints the generated message in three labeled sections (PROMPT, COMMAND, MESSAGE), then exits without staging, running hooks, or committing. For `commit`, `--stage` is honored against a temporary index — the previewed prompt matches what a real run would send the LLM, but the user's real index is never touched. `--show-prompt` is now hidden from `--help` but kept working for piping the rendered prompt to another LLM. ([#2557](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2557))

- **New `dirname` and `basename` template filters**: Two new filters expose `Path::parent` and `Path::file_name`, enabling path traversal that previous filters couldn't express. They unblock the bare-repo-in-hidden-directory layout (`myproject/.git`), where `{{ repo }}` resolves to `.git`: users can write `{{ repo_path | dirname | basename }}` to recover `myproject`. ([#2592](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2592), [#2605](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2605), thanks @seakayone for reporting [#1279](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1279) and @Xilis for raising the `parent_dir` question)

- **New `[remove] delete-branch` config option**: Setting `delete-branch = false` defaults `wt remove` to keeping branches, equivalent to passing `--no-delete-branch` every time. CLI flags still override the config either direction. ([#2589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2589), thanks @jameslairdsmith for [#2587](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2587))

- **`wt-perf timeline` subcommand for trace capture**: One command runs `wt`, captures stderr, parses `[wt-trace]` records, and prints a column-aligned text timeline (sorted by start time, with subprocess totals and externally-measured wall) or emits Chrome Trace Format JSON for Perfetto. Replaces the previous `RUST_LOG=debug wt … 2>&1 | wt-perf trace > trace.json` dance. ([#2558](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2558))

- **`wt list` skips redundant merge-tree probes on dirty worktrees**: For dirty worktrees with no unmerged entries, the dirty-tree probe is authoritative and the HEAD-only probe is skipped — one merge-tree subprocess per dirty row instead of two. The dirty probe also reflects the current working state, so when uncommitted changes resolve a HEAD conflict, `wt list` no longer reports it as conflicting. ([#2602](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2602))

- **Faster alias dispatch**: Two changes compound to cut warm alias-dispatch latency by ~25 ms — `Repository::prewarm` overlaps the three independent pre-dispatch reads (rev-parse, git config, user-config TOML) on scoped threads instead of running them in series, and `build_hook_context` only executes the four shell-out blocks (`default_branch`, `primary_worktree`, `commit`/`short_commit`, `remote`/`remote_url`/`upstream`) when the alias body actually references those template variables. ([#2556](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2556), [#2573](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2573))

- **Short-SHA display honors `core.abbrev`**: Sites that abbreviated a commit SHA previously sliced `&sha[..7]` or ran ad-hoc `git rev-parse --short` calls — 7-char prefixes regularly collide in larger repos and none of the slicing sites respected `core.abbrev`. The `step commit` / `step squash` success lines, the `step push --no-ff` "Merged to" line, the `{{ short_commit }}` template variable, post-remove hook context, the safety-backup ref display, the orphan-check `(detached <sha>)` label, and `wt list` row display all route through one canonical helper now. ([#2576](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2576), [#2577](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2577), [#2584](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2584))

- **Shell-integration hint escalates after repeat showings**: `worktrunk.hints.<name>` migrates from `"true"` to an integer counter so the system tracks how many times a hint has been displayed. After 5+ displays of the shell-integration install hint, it appends a `wt config show` pointer so users who keep seeing it can investigate why their wrapper isn't intercepting. Legacy `"true"` values parse as 0, so the next display normalises to 1; first-time-skip behaviour is unchanged. ([#2603](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2603))

- **Cleaner `wt config show` shell-integration section for new users**: Several follow-ups smooth the section's first impression. "Not configured" rows render as peer status lines (`○`) with bold shell name, matching `Already configured` and `Skipped`, instead of looking like a sub-bullet. The `type wt` verification hint only fires under the user's actual shell, not under every configured shell. On a stock zsh-only macOS, `bash` / `fish` / `nu` no longer render four `Skipped; ~/.foorc not found` rows — a new `Shell::is_installed()` PATH lookup filters them unless the binary is present. The status text now distinguishes "not configured" (no working integration anywhere) from "not active" (installed but not loaded in this session), with the install hint moved directly under the warning, and the `Skipped` row's shell name renders bold to match other status rows. ([#2562](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2562), [#2572](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2572), [#2574](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2574), [#2579](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2579))

### Fixed

- **`wt step prune` no longer trips a debug_assert on multi-line git errors**: When `git config` failed mid-prune, the multi-line stderr propagated as a top-level anyhow message with an empty chain — exactly the case `print_command_error`'s `debug_assert!(false, "Multiline error without context")` is designed to nag on. Debug builds (including `cargo test`) exited 101 instead of rendering the error. Targeted `.context(...)` wrappers on the prune call sites route prune errors through the structured rendering path. ([#2567](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2567))

- **`wt config update` no longer prints a redundant `wt config update` self-suggestion**: Every `wt` invocation against a deprecated config emitted a deprecation warning followed by a `to apply updates, run wt config update` hint — silly when the user was already running `wt config update`. The update command latches warning suppression before `Repository::prewarm`, then renders per-pattern warnings inline alongside its diff. `--print` is also fully silent on stderr now, matching its pipe-friendly intent. ([#2590](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2590))

- **`wt config show` iterates PowerShell uniformly with other shells**: PowerShell's status row went through a separate code path, producing a slightly different layout on Windows than on Unix. The shell loop now iterates the full set uniformly, so PowerShell renders the same way as `bash` / `zsh` / `fish` / `nu`. ([#2581](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2581))

### Internal

- **Library API rework** (Breaking library API): `cargo-semver-checks` reports several breaking changes — removed public exports (`worktrunk::git::interrupt_exit_code` / `worktrunk::git::exit_code` in [#2611](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2611), `worktrunk::shell_exec::trace_instant` in [#2554](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2554), struct `worktrunk::config::LoadedConfigs` in [#2573](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2573)); changed parameter count (`worktrunk::config::format_alias_variables` now takes 2 parameters instead of 1, in [#2556](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2556)); new `remove` field on `ResolvedConfig`, `UserConfig`, and `UserProjectOverrides` ([#2589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2589)).

- **Typed error variants gain a `Diagnostic` trait**: `Display` is now a single-line label suitable for embedding in `format!` strings, JSON output, or log files; `Diagnostic::render` produces the styled multi-line block (emoji, color, gutter, follow-up hints). Implemented for `GitError`, `WorktrunkError`, `HookErrorWithHint`, `TemplateExpandError`, and `CommandError`. The renderer in `format_command_error` walks the anyhow chain via `try_render_diagnostic` once instead of per-type downcast branches. ([#2580](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2580), [#2611](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2611))

- **Trace spans carry dynamic context**: Alias execution spans carry the alias name (`try_alias:deploy`, `run_alias:deploy`); `template_render` carries the command label; the concurrent-group span moved inside the per-command map so each render emits its own record. `Cmd::run` / `Cmd::pipe_into` trace emission consolidated behind `WtTraceLog::record_result`. ([#2554](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2554), [#2555](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2555), [#2613](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2613))

- **`HookLog::Shared` for branch-agnostic logs**: The trash sweep at `sweep_stale_trash` is repo-wide, but `HookLog::path()` always prefixed a branch segment, so the call site worked around this by passing a fake `"wt"` branch. The new `Shared(InternalOp)` variant resolves to `{log_dir}/internal/{op}.log` directly, alongside the other top-level shared logs. ([#2595](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2595))

## 0.47.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch <number>` suggests `pr:N` / `mr:N` first**: When `wt switch 2474` fails because no branch by that name exists, the hint now leads with how to switch to the matching PR/MR before mentioning `--create`. Platform is detected by hostname-matching the primary remote's effective URL (so `url.insteadOf` rewrites are respected): GitHub → `wt switch pr:N`, GitLab → `wt switch mr:N`, unknown host → both. Non-numeric branch names keep the original hint unchanged. ([#2516](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2516))

- **Faster alias and hook dispatch**: Trivial-alias wall time drops 30.4ms → 20.4ms (1.49× via hyperfine) from three changes — replacing the 10ms `try_wait`+sleep poll in `Cmd::stream` with an event-driven `Signals::forever()` listener (and the matching 25ms poll in `spawn_signal_forwarder`), merging the two cold-path `git rev-parse` forks (`--git-common-dir` and the `prewarm_info` batch) into one, and loading user and project config on scoped threads instead of sequentially. Ctrl-C latency on concurrent steps drops from "up to 25 ms" to "as soon as signal-hook delivers". ([#2537](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2537), [#2538](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2538), [#2541](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2541), [#2543](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2543))

- **`Running …` hook announce uses one canonical grammar**: Replaces the overloaded `Running <hook>: ...` punctuation with a layered grammar where each separator carries one meaning — `&` joins concurrent commands within a step, `,` joins serial steps within a pipeline, `;` joins source pipelines and hook-type clauses. Source label moves to a per-pipeline suffix annotation (`sync, push (user)`), so multi-source events no longer double-colon, and multi-hook-type events bundle onto a single line: `Running post-commit: mark (user); post-remove: cleanup (user); post-switch: notify (user); post-merge: sync (user) @ ~/repo`. ([#2504](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2504))

- **`(user)` / `(project)` source labels no longer rendered bold**: The `Running …` background-hook announce wrapped each pipeline's source label in `<bold>`, producing visually noisy bold inner text against parens that weren't bold. Source labels render as plain inner text now; named command names (`sync`, `push`, …) stay bold as before. ([#2514](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2514))

### Fixed

- **Integration detection now ORs local + upstream**: `wt list`, `wt remove`, `wt merge`, and `wt step prune` previously checked a single integration target picked by `effective_integration_target`, so a branch merged into local `main` while `origin/main` had unique commits (or vice versa) was misreported as unintegrated and skipped. `integration_reason` now considers both — integrated if either matches. ([#2507](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2507), [#2513](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2513), [#2515](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2515))

- **`wt step copy-ignored` no longer writes outside the destination through symlinked directories**: A symlinked destination directory (e.g. `target -> /tmp/outside`) let `copy-ignored` create files outside the worktree; `--force` made it riskier still by overwriting outside files. New guarded entry points reject paths whose resolved parent chain escapes the destination root. Leaf-symlink behavior is unchanged. ([#2501](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2501), thanks @douglas)

- **`wt step copy-ignored` no longer hardcodes `.pi/` in built-in excludes**: Removed from the default excludes list; users who need it can add it via the `[step.copy-ignored]` config. ([#2527](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2527), thanks @indigoviolet for reporting [#2526](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2526))

- **`wt step for-each -- <argv>` preserves quoting and argument boundaries**: The post-`--` argv was rebuilt with `args.join(" ")` and passed through `sh -c`, breaking anything with spaces, `;`, or shell metacharacters inside an argv element. It's now exec'd directly with no implicit shell. Users wanting shell features (pipes, redirects, `$VAR`, globs) write `sh -c '<snippet>'` explicitly — same pattern as `xargs`, `find -exec`. (Breaking: previously `wt step for-each -- <snippet>` accepted shell snippets without `sh -c`; `for-each` is `[experimental]`.) ([#2465](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2465))

### Documentation

- **`extending.md` hooks-vs-aliases comparison gains a stdin row**: The comparison table covered invocation, positional handling, approval flags, source filters, and template-context extras, but never said anything about stdin. Hooks have always received the template context as JSON on stdin; aliases inherit the parent's stdin so pipes pass through and interactive TUIs (`wt switch`) keep the tty. ([#2529](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2529))

- **`bench` command help cites the positional `FILTER` instead of `--skip`**: Criterion's CLI takes filter as a positional argument; `--skip` exists but the documented form was misleading. ([#2547](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2547))

- **CLAUDE.md codifies the local-first network access policy**: Adds a Network Access subsection under Command Execution Principles. Worktrunk is local-first; the only fall-through-to-the-wire helper is the first `Repository::default_branch()` call per repo. A TTL cache does not authorize background polling. ([#2536](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2536))

### Internal

- **`RefSnapshot` replaces ambient ref-keyed caches**: Callers now capture a point-in-time `RefSnapshot` and thread it through read paths instead of reading through cached `commit_shas`/`integration_reasons`/etc., which could go stale when wt itself moved a ref (e.g. `wt merge` advancing the local target). The `head_shas` per-worktree cache is also dropped so `{{ commit }}` reflects post-rebase HEAD movement. (Breaking library API: `Repository::ahead_behind`, `batch_ahead_behind`, `effective_integration_target`, `integration_target` removed; `Repository::integration_reason`, `worktrunk::copy::copy_dir_recursive`, `copy_leaf`, `worktrunk::git::compute_integration_lazy`, `remove_worktree_with_cleanup`, and `delete_branch_if_safe` each gained a parameter.) ([#2528](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2528), [#2530](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2530))

- **Aliases keyed by (name, source) and EXEC decided per step**: Same-name user+project alias collisions used to scrub EXEC for the whole merged pipeline; per-step decisions now keep the EXEC relaxation on user steps and scrub only project steps. Strictly more permissive than before. ([#2474](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2474), [#2521](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2521))

- **`Span` RAII guard for in-process `[wt-trace]` attribution**: Records `[wt-trace] span="name" dur_us=…` on drop, parsed by the existing chrome-trace renderer. Wired through alias dispatch, config load, `build_hook_context`, `template_render`, and `execute_shell_command`, so cold-cache attribution down to ~µs lands in `trace.json` for https://ui.perfetto.dev. ([#2539](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2539))

- **Codecov uploads enabled on fork PRs**: Drops the `github.repository_owner == 'max-sixty'` guards on both Codecov upload steps; the action falls back to tokenless when `CODECOV_TOKEN` is empty. ([#2535](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2535))

- **Nightly benchmark results append to a public gist** as JSONL (timestamp, commit SHA, mean_ns, stddev_ns) so results are queryable across runs. ([#2531](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2531), [#2532](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2532))

## 0.46.1

### Fixed

- **No spurious `Skipping pre-commit hooks (--no-hooks)` line after declined approval**: `wt step commit`, `wt step squash`, and `wt merge` collapsed two distinct hook-skip reasons — the user passing `--no-hooks` and the user declining an interactive approval prompt — into a single `verify: bool`. With hooks configured, declining produced both `○ Commands declined, committing without hooks` and `○ Skipping pre-commit hooks (--no-hooks)` back-to-back; the second line was wrong because the user never passed `--no-hooks`. The call chain now carries a `HookGate` (`Run` / `NoHooksFlag` / `Silent`), so declined-approval paths skip hooks silently while the explicit `--no-hooks` flag still prints its message exactly once. ([#2485](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2485))

### Internal

- **`HookAnnouncer` is the single entry point for hook dispatch**: `post-commit` and `post-switch` now route through the same announcer used by other phases, and remaining call sites adopt `TemplateVars` for variable assembly. ([#2481](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2481), [#2482](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2482), [#2484](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2484))

- **Merge cleanup extracted**: The post-merge finish sequence moves into `worktree::finish_after_merge`, and `wt list` threads the placeholder explicitly instead of reaching through `Cell`. ([#2491](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2491), [#2492](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2492))

- **CI consolidated onto a shared composite action**: New advisory `cargo-affected` jobs land, and the test matrix and affected-jobs setup now share one composite action. ([#2475](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2475), [#2483](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2483), [#2486](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2486))

## 0.46.0

### Improved

- **`sanitize_db` template filter caps output at 48 chars** (was 63 — PostgreSQL's identifier limit). The new budget leaves headroom for users composing the output into longer paths or identifiers, e.g., Unix socket paths capped at 107 bytes. The 3-character hash suffix is unchanged, so collision avoidance is preserved at the new budget; only the truncated base shrinks. (Breaking: branches whose previous `sanitize_db` output exceeded 48 chars get a different identifier — most names are well under 48 and pass through unchanged.) ([#2467](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2467), thanks @yajo for [#2397](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2397))

- **New `hash` template filter**: `{{ value | hash }}` produces a 3-character base36 digest of the input — useful for composing custom truncate-with-collision-avoidance recipes when `sanitize_db`'s 48-char budget still isn't tight enough. ([#2453](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2453))

- **Background hook announces collapse to one line per command**: `wt merge` (with removal) previously emitted two or three separate `◎ Running …` lines for `post-remove + post-switch` and `post-merge`. Hooks across all phases of a single command now share one combined announce: `◎ Running post-remove: user:cleanup; post-switch: user:notify; post-merge: user:sync`. ([#2457](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2457))

- **Picker-driven `post-switch` hooks now receive `target` / `target_worktree_path`** template variables, matching hooks fired from `wt switch <branch>`. Closes a pre-existing asymmetry where interactive switching exposed strictly fewer variables than the non-interactive path. ([#2470](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2470))

### Fixed

- **`wt <alias>` stdout is pipeable again**: `wt my-alias | tr …` (and any other downstream pipe) silently produced no output because the foreground executor redirected every alias body's stdout to wt's stderr — a hook-only redirect that PR [#2089](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2089) inherited uniformly. Aliases now pass stdout through; hooks and `wt step for-each` keep the merged-stderr behavior so their output stays ordered with wt's own status messages. ([#2479](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2479), thanks @davidmyersdev for reporting [#2478](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2478))

- **`wt switch <symlink>` resolves to the existing worktree** instead of failing with `No branch named …`. The path-based fallback in `Repository::worktree_at_path` previously compared paths via lexical normalization only, so symlink-equivalent spellings never matched. The same symlink-aware comparison is now used everywhere the library identifies a worktree by path. ([#2466](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2466))

- **Deleted-CWD recovery handles symlinked subdirectories**: When a worktree is removed while a shell sits in a subdirectory whose parents include a symlink (e.g. `~/link/repo.feature/src`), `wt` now finds the parent repository and recovers as expected. Previously the symlink-aware path compared only file names and bailed for any path deeper than the worktree root. ([#2464](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2464))

- **Merge safety backups for slash branches**: `WorkingTree::create_safety_backup()` flattened `/` to `-` in the ref path, so distinct branches like `a/b` and `a-b` collided at the same `refs/wt-backup/a-b` ref — the latest backup for one could clobber the other, and the documented `refs/wt-backup/<branch>` recovery path didn't match what was actually written. Slashes are valid in git ref names; the branch name is now used as-is. ([#2463](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2463))

- **Nushell wrapper migrates to function-level `@complete`**: Per fdncred's recommendation in [nushell/nushell#18128](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/18128), the wrapper replaces the parameter-level `[...args: string@"nu-complete wt"]` with a function-level `@complete` attribute on an untyped `[...args]` rest, and the completer signature moves from `[context: string]` (with manual `split row " "` reconstruction) to `[spans: list<string>]`. Net deletion of seven lines of fragile token reassembly; once [nushell/nushell#18131](https://github.com/nushell/nushell/issues/18131) ships in stable nu the wrapper will automatically benefit from `--flag="value"` quote stripping and `~` expansion. ([#2458](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2458))

### Internal

- **Hook dispatch unified**: A single `HookAnnouncer` orchestrates per-command announces across phases, replacing scattered `CommandOrigin`-keyed dispatch with closures, and the various background-hook entry points now share one path. Switch and merge sites assemble template variables through a single `TemplateVars` builder. ([#2457](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2457), [#2470](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2470), [#2472](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2472), [#2477](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2477))

- **`wt list` rendering modes collapse**: The internal `RenderTarget` enum replaces three parallel rendering paths, the JSON path skips the per-result render that the formatter never used, and dead `is_tty` plumbing is removed. ([#2469](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2469), [#2473](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2473))

- **Push handling switches to a `PushKind` enum** instead of sniffing verb strings ([#2468](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2468)); `try_alias` and `step_alias` share one help-intercept implementation ([#2471](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2471)); lazy template expansion in the command executor lives in one place via `resolve_command_str` ([#2476](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2476)).

## 0.45.2

### Fixed

- **Interactive pickers via aliases no longer freeze with a blank screen**: After the v0.44.0 fix that let aliases inherit the controlling tty ([#2380](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2380)), `wt sw` (and other aliases that wrap `wt switch`) still hung — the alias child was placed in a new process group, so when the skim picker called `tcsetattr` on `/dev/tty` the kernel raised SIGTTOU and stopped it mid-render. The interactive (no-stdin-payload) execution path now keeps the alias child in wt's process group; a PID-targeted signal forwarder ensures externally-delivered signals (`kill -TERM <wt-pid>`) still reach the child. Hooks (which receive JSON on stdin) are unaffected. ([#2444](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2444))

### Improved

- **`wt <alias> --help` hint follows output guidelines**: The hint emitted on `wt <alias> --help` previously printed to stdout without a status symbol, used backticks around commands, and stacked three indented bullet suggestions. It now renders as an info line plus a single semicolon-joined hint on stderr, with commands styled via underline (dim-safe). ([#2447](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2447))

## 0.45.1

### Fixed

- **`worktrunk` builds again with `--no-default-features`** (regression in v0.45.0): The TTY progress spinner added in [#2420](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2420) used `crossterm` unconditionally, but `crossterm` is gated behind the `cli` feature in `Cargo.toml`. `cargo install --locked --no-default-features worktrunk` and library consumers depending on worktrunk with `default-features = false` failed to compile. The crossterm-using internals are now `#[cfg(feature = "cli")]`-gated; without `cli`, `Progress` degrades to a no-op (the public API is unchanged). The bug slipped past the in-workspace `cargo hack check --feature-powerset --no-dev-deps` because workspace dev-dependencies pull `crossterm` in transitively and Cargo's feature unifier leaks it into the lib build. ([#2441](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2441))

### Improved

- **Deprecation warnings for `--claude-code` flag and `wt hook post-create` alias**: Both surfaces previously mapped silently to their canonical replacements (`--format=claude-code` and `pre-start`), giving users no signal to migrate before eventual removal. Each invocation now emits a stderr warning, matching the pattern used by `wt select`, `--no-verify`, and `wt hook approvals`. ([#2436](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2436))

## 0.45.0

### Improved

- **`wt remove --foreground` shows a TTY progress spinner**: Removing a worktree with a fat `node_modules` (or any large trash payload) now prints `⠼ Removing 7,272 files · 64.5 MiB` to stderr while the unlink proceeds, with a matching `(N files · X MiB)` suffix on the success line. TTY-gated; pipes and the background path are byte-for-byte unchanged. Driven by the same machinery introduced for `wt step copy-ignored` in [#2413](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2413). ([#2420](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2420))

- **`wt step copy-ignored` shows a TTY progress spinner**: Large copies of `node_modules`, `build/`, or `target/` previously ran silently. A stderr-only spinner (`⠼ Copying 7,272 files · 64.5 MiB`) ticks while the copy proceeds, gated on TTY + `verbosity == 0` + not `--dry-run`, with a 300ms startup delay so sub-second copies stay quiet. ([#2413](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2413), thanks @tehdb for the suggestion)

- **`wt switch -c <new> --base <name>` accepts a remote-only base**: `--base releases/4.x.x` previously failed with `No branch, tag, or commit named "releases/4.x.x"` when the branch existed only as a remote-tracking ref. The bare name now resolves through the single matching remote (the existing safety code still unsets the new branch's upstream so a stray `git push` doesn't target the base). Multi-remote and zero-remote cases pass through unchanged. ([#2411](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2411), thanks @viicslen for reporting [#2410](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2410))

- **LLM `wt step commit` summaries surfaced in `wt config state`**: `wt config state get` now includes a `SUMMARY CACHE` table (and JSON section) listing per-branch entries, and `wt config state clear` removes them alongside markers/vars/CI status. Backed by a new content-addressed layout at `.git/wt/cache/summary/{branch}/{hash}.json` so a cache hit is a single file-existence check. ([#2407](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2407))

### Fixed

- **`wt config state clear` no longer reports "Cleared 0" when an I/O or config error actually occurred**: Across markers, vars, previous-branch, default-branch, and CI-status (single + aggregate), eleven `unwrap_or(false)` / `let _ = unset_config(...)` swallows silently turned real failures into "nothing to clear" messages. Genuine `git config --unset` failures and `read_dir`/`remove_file` errors now surface; the common "key didn't exist" exit-5 path stays silent. The shared `clear_*` machinery for the on-disk caches is now consolidated in `worktrunk::cache`. ([#2394](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2394), [#2400](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2400))

- **`wt config state ci-status clear <branch>` actually clears the cache file**: The single-branch path was still calling `unset_config("worktrunk.state.<branch>.ci-status")` from before the cache moved to `.git/wt/cache/ci-status/<branch>.json`. The command always took the info branch and never touched the real cache; `--all` was already correct. ([#2392](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2392))

- **`wt config state get/clear ci-status` for `origin/foo`-style branches when a same-named local branch exists**: A local branch literally named `origin/foo` would shadow the remote-tracking ref — `is_remote` resolved against the remote while the SHA used for cache keys came from the local branch, so `gh`/`glab` was invoked for the remote while the cache tracked the local. A single `for-each-ref` query now sources `is_remote`, the short name, and the HEAD SHA from the same ref. Tags and raw SHAs passed via `--branch` now return `BranchNotFound` instead of being accepted as "local branches" with nonsensical CI lookups. ([#2388](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2388))

### Documentation

- **`worktrunk.dev/llms.txt` plus `.md` companions for every page**: Each docs page is now also served as clean markdown at `worktrunk.dev/<page>.md`, with an `llms.txt` index per the [llms.txt spec](https://llmstxt.org/) so LLM tools can find the docs without scraping HTML. ([#2404](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2404))

- **Static command-output blocks for the GIF-heavy docs pages**: `merge`, `step`, `remove`, `hook`, and `llm-commits` now include realistic colorized command-output blocks driven by insta snapshots, alongside (or instead of) the GIFs — so they stay in lockstep with what `wt` actually prints. ([#2405](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2405), thanks @drewnoakes for reporting [#2403](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2403))

- **Conda / Pixi installation listed in the install section**: The README and worktrunk-page install table now mention the conda-forge package alongside Homebrew, Cargo, winget, and pacman. ([#2425](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2425), thanks @noamgot for reporting [#2424](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2424))

- **FAQ documents the new summary cache layout**: The "What files does Worktrunk create?" inventory now includes the `.git/wt/cache/summary/{branch}/{hash}.json` LLM-summary cache. ([#2408](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2408))

### Internal

- **Three on-disk caches unified onto a shared `worktrunk::cache` module**: `sha_cache`, `ci_status`, and the new `summary` cache now share one implementation of torn-write semantics, error policy, LRU sweep, and clear mechanics. The `summaries/` directory is renamed `summary/` to match the singular-operation convention used by every other kind (`ci-status`, `is-ancestor`, etc.); stale `summaries/` dirs are harmless. (Breaking library API: `Repository::clear_git_commands_cache` and `Repository::git_commands_cache_count` removed; `worktrunk::copy::copy_dir_recursive` now takes 4 parameters instead of 3 and `worktrunk::copy::copy_leaf` now returns `Result<Option<u64>>` instead of `Result<bool>` to thread the progress reporter.) ([#2407](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2407), [#2420](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2420))

- **`Repository::root()` no longer caches the fallback path** for callers outside any work tree, dropping the dedicated `prewarm_is_inside` sentinel cache — `worktree_roots.contains_key(path)` is now a reliable "path is inside a work tree" signal. No external behavior change. ([#2390](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2390))

- **MSRV bumped from 1.93 to 1.94** following the latest stable − 1 policy. ([#2423](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2423))

- **Claude Code plugin now uses the commit SHA for versioning**: The static `version: 1.0.0` in the plugin manifest hadn't moved despite ongoing changes to skills and hooks. Removing it lets Claude Code use the commit SHA, so every commit becomes an update for installed users. ([#2402](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2402))

- **Docs-sync pipeline simplification**: `--help-page` plain/web paths unified behind `PageMode` ([#2412](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2412)); blank-line corruption in mixed `$ cmd + output` blocks fixed at the root in `convert_dollar_console_to_terminal` and the `MARKER_OPEN_PREFIX`/`MARKER_CLOSE` constants extracted ([#2417](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2417), [#2418](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2418)); three sync tests collapsed into `test_docs_are_in_sync` and dead inner snapshot wrappers stripped ([#2419](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2419)); mirrored close form retired in favour of bare with a `test_no_nested_auto_generated_markers` invariant guard ([#2422](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2422)); two more sync helpers aligned with the per-file error channel ([#2427](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2427)); `write_tracked` helper extracted and 14 auto-generated outputs marked `linguist-generated=true` so PR diffs collapse them ([#2409](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2409)). `running-tend` skill leads bug-triage asks with `wt -vv <command>` so a single gist URL replaces multi-step diagnostic chains ([#2415](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2415), thanks @viicslen for the feedback in [#2410](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2410)).

- **`CiBranchName::from_branch_ref` takes `&BranchRef`** instead of `(&str, bool)`, removing the historical "string from one source, bool from another" footgun. ([#2391](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2391))

## 0.44.0

### Fixed

- **Interactive alias children (e.g. `sw = "wt switch"`) keep the tty again**: Alias execution was piping the template context JSON into each child's stdin, displacing the controlling terminal; interactive commands like `wt switch` then saw a pipe and bailed with `Interactive picker requires an interactive terminal`. Hooks still receive the documented JSON-on-stdin contract; aliases now inherit stdin unchanged. ([#2380](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2380), thanks @KieranP for reporting in [#406](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/406))

- **`wt list --remotes` stats were shadowed by a same-named local branch**: If a user created a local branch literally named `origin/foo`, the remote row for `origin/foo` silently reported ahead/behind (and every other integration stat) against the local branch, because `git rev-parse` prefers `refs/heads/` over `refs/remotes/`. Integration helpers now pass fully-qualified refs; a follow-up refactor makes the disambiguation unrepresentable at the type level by storing full refs on `BranchRef`. ([#2365](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2365), [#2378](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2378))

- **`{{ commit }}` resolves to the per-worktree HEAD in `wt step for-each` on detached worktrees**: The hook context was reading HEAD via a process-CWD-keyed cache, so when `for-each` iterated over sibling worktrees with one on detached HEAD, `{{ commit }}` resolved to the running worktree's SHA instead of the sibling's. ([#2382](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2382))

- **Global-scope `core.worktree` no longer misdetects the repo root in normal non-bare repos**: The 0.43.0 `repo_path()` fast path ([#2350](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2350)) read `core.worktree` from the bulk config map, which merges global and system scope — but git itself only honors `core.worktree` from local config for worktree discovery. When the bulk map reports `core.worktree` we now delegate to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` so git applies its own scope rules. The common case (no `core.worktree` anywhere) still skips the subprocess. ([#2362](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2362))

- **`post-create` hook config is now rejected with an explicit error instead of silently migrating to `pre-start`**: Clears the silent migration ahead of the planned `*-start` → `*-create` rename (see [#1571](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1571)). ([#2361](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2361))

### Internal

- **Branch enumeration consolidated into a single canonical inventory, with follow-on perf wins**: Five overlapping `for-each-ref` accessors in `src/git/repository/branches.rs` collapsed into two cached scans (`refs/heads/` and `refs/remotes/`), exposed as `Repository::local_branches()` and `remote_branches()`. Shared inventory also powers `Branch::remotes()` ([#2371](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2371)), `strip_remote_prefix` ([#2372](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2372)), and `is_remote_tracking_branch` ([#2377](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2377)), dropping a `rev-parse`/`git remote` subprocess each. `BranchRef` stores full refs ([#2378](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2378)); `prewarm_info` returns a typed snapshot with HEAD SHA folded in ([#2367](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2367)); alias on-branch dispatch reuses the cached HEAD SHA ([#2374](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2374)); `list_worktrees` caches on `RepoCache` ([#2375](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2375), [#2383](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2383)); `wt list` commit subjects batched pre-skeleton, retiring `CommitDetailsTask` ([#2369](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2369), [#2379](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2379)); picker's speculative preview warm-up primes `prewarm_info` once ([#2381](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2381)). (Breaking library API: `Repository::list_local_branches`, `list_remote_branches`, `list_tracked_upstreams`, `list_untracked_remote_branches`, `commit_timestamps`, `commit_details`, `current_worktree_info`, `Branch::upstream_single`, and `BranchRef { branch, is_remote }` fields are removed; `Repository::batch_ahead_behind` returns `()`.) ([#2368](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2368))

## 0.43.0

### Fixed

- **`wt step copy-ignored` no longer self-lowers priority in the foreground**: Since v0.37.0, `copy-ignored` wrapped its work in `taskpolicy -b` (macOS) / `ionice -c3` (Linux) unconditionally, which throttled disk I/O for interactive runs and synchronous `pre-*` hooks — not just the background `post-start` flows the lowering was meant for. Detached background hook pipelines now set an internal sentinel, and `copy-ignored` only self-lowers when it sees it. Interactive `wt step copy-ignored` and foreground hooks run at normal priority. See `wt step copy-ignored --help` → *Background-hook priority*. ([#2358](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2358), thanks @bram-rongen for reporting [#2342](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2342))

- **`wt step commit` no longer panics on large CRLF diffs containing multi-byte UTF-8**: `parse_diff_sections` used `str::lines()` (strips `\n` and `\r\n`) but advanced the byte-offset accumulator by `line.len() + 1`, under-counting one byte per CRLF line. Once the diff exceeded the 400k filtering threshold the drift landed inside a multi-byte character and panicked with `byte index N is not a char boundary`. Now iterates with `split_inclusive('\n')` so offsets match real byte positions regardless of line-ending style. ([#2356](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2356), closes [#2355](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2355), thanks @Qnurye for reporting with a minimal reproduction)

- **`wt step relocate` surfaces failed `git checkout`/`git worktree move` instead of printing false success**: The four raw `Cmd::new("git")...run()?` call sites in `relocate.rs` swallowed non-zero exit codes — only spawn errors propagated through `?` — so a failed checkout or move returned `Ok` and the caller printed `Relocated 1 worktree`. All four sites now route through `repo.worktree_at(path).run_command(...)`, the project's fail-fast git pattern. Triggered most often when `worktrunk.default-branch` cached a branch that no longer resolves locally. ([#2348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2348))

### Improved

- **Alias dispatch ~15-20% faster via batched `rev-parse`**: Parent-side alias dispatch was firing four separate `git rev-parse` subprocesses on the worktree path (`--is-inside-work-tree`, `--show-toplevel`, `--git-dir`, `--symbolic-full-name HEAD`). A new `WorkingTree::prewarm_info` folds all four selectors into a single invocation and populates the `worktree_roots`, `git_dirs`, and `current_branches` caches so later accessors hit cache. `benches/alias`: `warm/1` 53.3 → 43.5 ms (−19.6%), `cold/100` 62.1 → 49.7 ms (−18.2%). On systems with slow `execve` (macOS Gatekeeper, AV), three saved forks translate to ~600 ms per `wt <alias>`. ([#2352](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2352), thanks @markjaquith for continuing to report [#2322](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2322))

- **Non-submodule repos no longer pay for a failing submodule probe**: `Repository::repo_path()` used to run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` inside `.git` to resolve the submodule case — that probe fails unconditionally on normal repos, costing ~5 ms per call. Now reads `core.worktree` directly from the bulk config map (the same signal git itself uses): bare repos short-circuit on `core.bare`, submodules read `core.worktree`, normal repos fall through to `parent(git_common_dir)`. hyperfine on a healthy macOS system: `wt noop` in a normal repo 53.2 → 48.8 ms (1.09×); in a submodule 62.1 → 55.5 ms (1.12×). `repo_path()` fires ~2× during alias dispatch, so the win compounds. ([#2350](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2350), thanks @markjaquith for reporting [#2322](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2322))

### Documentation

- **`pre-start` and `post-start` hook rows say when the hook fires, not just what to put in it**: The hook types table rows for `pre-start` and `post-start` now match the phrasing of neighbouring rows (`pre-switch` has "Runs before…", `post-merge` has "Runs in the target…"): "Runs once when a new worktree is created, blocking `post-start`/`--execute` until complete" and "Runs once when a new worktree is created, in the background". ([#2360](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2360), thanks @ortonomy for reporting [#1571](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1571))

- **Hook docs: Recipes restructured as a table of contents**: The "Designing Effective Hooks" umbrella heading was removed; "Recipes" is promoted to a top-level section with each bullet leading with a specifically-named link to its [Tips & Patterns](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/) section. "Copying untracked files" moved up next to the JSON context section. ([#2349](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2349), [#2351](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2351))

- **Refreshed stale docstrings** across recently refactored modules. ([#2354](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2354))

### Internal

- **`ahead_behind` collapsed into single get-or-insert accessor**: `cached_ahead_behind` was open-coded get-or-insert at the call site. `ahead_behind` now reads `cache.ahead_behind` first and falls back to the merge-base + rev-list computation on miss, caching the result. The `wt list` ahead/behind task collapses from a manual cache check + dual codepath to a single call. `batch_ahead_behind` still primes the cache in bulk on git ≥ 2.36. (Breaking library API: `Repository::cached_ahead_behind` removed.) ([#2347](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2347))

## 0.42.0

### Improved

- **Alias banner is silent when there's nothing to summarize**: `◎ Running alias <name>` now only prints when the alias has at least one named step worth naming. Single unnamed aliases (`ls = "wt list"`) and all-anonymous pipelines return no announcement — the banner was just echoing the user's typed name. Pipelines with named steps keep their informative summary (`◎ Running alias deploy: install; build, lint`). `-v` still prints the bare form as a confirmation line. ([#2339](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2339), thanks @markjaquith for reporting [#2322](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2322))

- **Alias dispatch ~30% faster via batched git config reads**: `RepoCache` now reads every config key with a single `git config --list -z` instead of one `git config` subprocess per key. Config-backed accessors (`is_bare`, `primary_remote`, `remote_url`, `default_branch` fast path, `switch_previous`, `has_shown_hint`, `core.fsmonitor`, `core.pager`, and more) resolve via an O(1) map lookup. Writes route through `set_config_value` / `unset_config` helpers that update the on-disk config and the in-memory map together. Benchmarked on `benches/alias`: `warm/1` 77.4 → 56.9 ms (−29%), `cold/100` 80.5 → 54.5 ms (−30%) — ~25 ms saved per `wt <alias>` invocation. ([#2344](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2344), [#2346](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2346), thanks @markjaquith for reporting [#2322](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2322))

- **Further O(1) single-branch upstream lookups on `wt merge` / `wt switch`**: Follow-up to [#2337](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2337). `effective_integration_target` and the `wt switch` tracking-info report switched from bulk `Branch::upstream()` (a `for-each-ref` over every local branch) to `upstream_single()` — `wt list` still uses the bulk cache, but one-shot callers no longer pay for it. ([#2338](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2338))

- **Stale cached default branch surfaces a clear error with a reset hint**: `default_branch()`'s fast path no longer re-validates the cached `worktrunk.default-branch` on every call; when the cached value is stale, `require_target_branch` / `require_target_ref` raise a new `StaleDefaultBranch` error that names the cache key and suggests clearing it. `wt list --branches` opportunistically warns when the cached default isn't among the enumerated branches — no extra `git` fork. (The old silent fallback + two preflight warning sites are removed.) ([#2344](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2344))

### Documentation

- **`worktrunk` skill: non-interactive hook approval guidance**: `skills/worktrunk/SKILL.md` now covers the hook-approval prompt error that agents hit running `wt merge` (or any command that runs project hooks) in a non-interactive session. Explains `wt config approvals add` (interactive, persists to `~/.config/worktrunk/approvals.toml`) vs `--yes` (single-invocation bypass for CI/CD), and directs agents to escalate rather than auto-`--yes`, since pre-approval is a trust decision. ([#2343](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2343))

### Internal

- **Flaky `test_switch_picker_preview_panel_main_diff` on macOS**: Under heavy parallel load, skim's `N/M` match counter updated ahead of the list-panel repaint, so `wait_for_stable` could declare a screen stable with stale rows still visible (~1-in-120 failure rate). The stability check now rejects states where skim's parsed match count doesn't equal the visible list-row count. Closes [#2334](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2334). ([#2345](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2345))

- **`benches/alias` regression guard for parent-side dispatch overhead**: Five-variant harness (`wt --version` startup floor; noop alias at 1/100 worktrees × warm/cold caches) protects the #2337/#2338 O(1) upstream work and the #2344 bulk config read. ([#2340](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2340))

- **Remove/TTFO benches invalidate `wt` caches between iterations**: `benches/remove.rs::first_output` and `benches/time_to_first_output.rs::remove` were reporting warm-cache cost because iter 1 populated `.git/wt/cache/` and iter 2+ hit it. Now use `iter_batched` + `invalidate_caches_auto` (which also clears `worktrunk.default-branch`). `benches/CLAUDE.md` documents the rule and the full list of what `invalidate_caches_auto` clears vs. preserves. ([#2341](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2341))

## 0.41.0

### Improved

- **Hooks accept the same `--KEY=VALUE` smart routing as aliases**: `wt hook pre-merge --branch=foo --yes` binds `{{ branch }}` when the template references it; unreferenced `--KEY=VALUE` tokens and everything after `--` forward as `{{ args }}`, now available in hook templates. `wt hook --help` lists every hook type. `--var KEY=VALUE` still works but emits a deprecation warning pointing at the new form. ([#2313](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2313))

- **`-v` prints resolved template variables for every hook and alias**: Before each `◎ Running …` line, `wt` shows a `template variables:` block listing every variable in scope for that hook type or alias and the value it resolved to for this invocation. Vars in scope but unpopulated render as `(unset)` — which is how e.g. `target_worktree_path` surfaces during `wt switch -` on hooks that don't receive it. Alias `args` renders shell-escaped so the table matches what `{{ args }}` substitutes below. Works in foreground, background hook pipelines, and alias expansion. ([#2316](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2316), [#2324](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2324), [#2328](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2328), thanks @nicolasff for reporting [#2309](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2309))

- **O(1) upstream lookup in alias/hook template context**: `Branch::upstream()` triggered a `for-each-ref` scanning every local branch — amortized across bulk consumers like `wt list`, but wasted work for alias/hook template dispatch, which only needs the current branch. A new `upstream_single()` runs a scoped `for-each-ref refs/heads/<branch>`, so the parent-side alias dispatch is fully O(1) in branch count. Noticeable on machines with slow fork cost (macOS Gatekeeper, AV, slow FS). ([#2337](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2337), thanks @markjaquith for reporting [#2322](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2322))

### Fixed

- **Symbolic switch targets (`-`, `@`, `^`) resolve before pre-switch hooks fire**: `wt switch -` previously built the pre-switch hook context from the raw `-` argument, so `{{ target }}` and `{{ target_worktree_path }}` were wrong or unset. Symbolic targets are now resolved to the concrete branch name before the hook context is built, so hooks see the destination worktree correctly. ([#2310](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2310), thanks @nicolasff for reporting [#2309](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2309))

- **Typo errors across `wt`, `wt step`, and `wt config alias show/dry-run` share one format**: Four typo surfaces previously split across clap-native `error:` / `tip:` output (exit 2) and custom anyhow gutters (exit 1). All four now render the same clap-native layout — `config alias show/dry-run` say "alias" / "aliases" instead of "subcommand" / "subcommands" since the positional is an alias name. The `wt <typo>` and `wt step <typo>` paths also now run `finish_command` cleanup, so diagnostic dumps and ANSI resets still fire. ([#2306](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2306), [#2307](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2307), [#2308](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2308))

### Documentation

- **Extending and hook guides consolidated**: Recipes on `extending.md` and `hook.md` were trimmed, overlapping sections (pre-start vs post-start, copy-ignored variants, pipeline forms) folded together, template-engine scope clarified, and dev-server / database / target-specific hook recipes moved to [Tips & Patterns](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/). ([#2314](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2314), [#2315](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2315), [#2317](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2317), [#2318](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2318), [#2319](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2319), [#2321](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2321), [#2323](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2323), [#2326](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2326), [#2329](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2329), [#2333](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2333))

- **Render fixes**: Tables inside `<details>` blocks pick up the site's table styling ([#2325](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2325)); alternate pages excluded from the sitemap with trailing slashes on nav links ([#2320](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2320)); the `[Aliases]` help link renamed to `[Extending Worktrunk guide]` so it reads as a doc pointer rather than a self-reference in terminal help ([#2330](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2330)).

### Internal

- **Zola link regex handles code spans in link text**: The skill-sync regex rejected `` [`…code…`](@/…) `` links, silently shipping dead `@/…md` references into skill reference files. The regex now balances code spans, and a post-transform guardrail panics on any leftover `@/…md` so future misses fail loudly. ([#2327](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2327))

## 0.40.0

### Improved

- **Aliases route `--KEY=VALUE` to template variables and forward everything else as `{{ args }}`**: `--KEY=VALUE` (or `--KEY VALUE`) binds `KEY` whenever the template references `{{ KEY }}` — `wt deploy --env=staging` sets `{{ env }}` to `staging`. Everything else joins `{{ args }}`, a space-joined, shell-escaped sequence ready to splice into a command. With `s = "wt switch {{ args }}"`, `wt s some-branch` expands to `wt switch some-branch`. Index with `{{ args[0] }}`, loop with `{% for a in args %}…`, count with `{{ args | length }}`; each element is escaped individually, so `wt run 'a b' 'c;d'` renders as `'a b' 'c;d'` — no shell injection. Tokens after `--` forward unconditionally, bypassing any binding. Hyphens in keys become underscores: `--my-var=x` binds `{{ my_var }}`. Built-in vars can be overridden inside the template — `--branch=foo` sets `{{ branch }}` for the invocation, but the worktree's actual branch doesn't move. (Breaking: `--var KEY=VALUE` and `--var=KEY=VALUE` removed; `wt <alias>` no longer errors on unrecognized flags — they forward to `{{ args }}`.) ([#2280](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2280), [#2287](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2287), [#2304](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2304))

- **`-y, --yes` is a top-level global flag**: Lives once on `Cli` instead of being duplicated across switch, remove, merge, commit, squash, prune, the ten hook subcommands, shell install/uninstall, plugin install/uninstall, and config update. `wt -y <anything>`, `wt <anything> --yes`, and `wt --yes <anything>` all skip approval and confirmation prompts for that invocation. (Breaking: post-alias `--yes` removed — use the global form `wt -y <alias>`.) ([#2279](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2279), [#2290](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2290))

- **`wt config alias show` and `wt config alias dry-run`**: `show` prints the configured template tagged by source (user/project). `dry-run` previews what an invocation would run without executing — `wt config alias dry-run s -- target-branch` renders exactly what `wt s target-branch` would produce. Output annotates routing with `# bound:` and `# args:` comments so you can see how each token was interpreted. Both warn when the alias name shadows a top-level built-in (e.g. `list`, `switch`); the alias is only reachable via `wt step <name>`. `wt <alias> --help` / `-h` prints a hint pointing at these subcommands rather than silently forwarding the flag into `{{ args }}`; use `wt <alias> -- --help` to forward. (Breaking: `wt <alias> --dry-run` and `wt step <alias> --dry-run` retired — use the new subcommand.) ([#2291](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2291), [#2304](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2304))

- **`wt config approvals` replaces `wt hook approvals`**: Approvals cover both project hooks and project aliases, so the old namespace under `hook` mis-scoped the command. `add` now walks both hook and alias commands — a project that only declares aliases can bulk-pre-approve in one shot. `wt hook approvals` remains as a hidden alias that emits a deprecation warning and forwards. ([#2282](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2282))

- **Scope-aware template variable validation**: A new `ValidationScope` (`Hook(HookType)`, `SwitchExecute`, `Alias`) drives validation across every template surface. `{{ args }}` only validates inside aliases; `{{ target }}` only in switch/start/merge contexts; `{{ pr_number }}` only in PR-aware switch hooks. A typo like `{{ target }}` in a `pre-start` hook is caught at validation time instead of failing at runtime with an undefined-var error after the worktree was created. ([#2288](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2288))

- **`pr_number` and `pr_url` template variables for PR/MR worktree hooks**: Available in `pre-switch`, `post-switch`, `pre-start`, and `post-start` when the worktree was created via `wt switch pr:N` / `mr:N`. One canonical pair for both GitHub and GitLab — no separate `mr_*` aliases. Previously the runtime injected these in `pre-start` only and the validator rejected them, so the feature was unreachable. ([#2300](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2300))

- **`target` template variable injected symmetrically on switch/create/start**: `pre-switch` already injected `target` (and conditionally `target_worktree_path`); `post-switch`, `pre-start`, and `post-start` now do too. A user writing `{{ target }}` in `post-start` no longer hits an undefined-var error at runtime. ([#2295](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2295))

- **Single announce line for combined background hooks**: When user and project hooks both fire on post-merge, post-commit, post-start/post-switch, or post-remove, output collapses into one `◎ Running <hook>: user:…, project:… @ <path>` line instead of one per source. Extracted a shared `spawn_background_hooks` so every site uses the same path. ([#2294](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2294), [#2298](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2298))

- **`wt config state get` shows trash and git commands cache**: Two categories that `wt config state clear` sweeps (`.git/wt/trash/` staged worktree directories and `.git/wt/cache/` SHA-keyed caches) were missing from `state get`, so users could clear state without ever knowing those entries existed. ([#2292](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2292))

### Fixed

- **Reject underscore in `vars` keys with a clear error**: `wt config state vars set db_suffix=foo` previously passed validation and then failed with a cryptic `error: invalid key: worktrunk.state.main.vars.db_suffix` from git (git config variable names must match `[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*`). Now rejected at `validate_vars_key` with a message pointing users to use hyphens instead. ([#2285](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2285), thanks @Mziserman)

- **Surface the full anyhow error chain in spawn and ref-update messages**: `Failed to spawn pipeline: Failed to spawn detached process` previously dropped the underlying `io::Error` (errno + OS description). Three sites switched from `{err}` to `{err:#}` so the full source chain renders — affects pipeline spawn warnings, `wt switch` LLM-summary preview errors, and `git push` failure messages. ([#2251](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2251))

- **Template parse errors in aliases now surface before flag routing**: A syntax error in any alias step previously caused that step to silently contribute no names to the referenced-var set, which could change how `--KEY=VALUE` tokens bound vs. forwarded as positionals; the syntax error only surfaced later at expansion time. Now errors propagate up front so flag routing isn't determined by malformed templates. ([#2299](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2299))

### Documentation

- **Hook template variables grouped by kind**: Variables in help text and docs now follow a consistent ordering (worktree, base, target, PR/MR, hook infrastructure) instead of mixed kinds. ([#2303](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2303))

- **Aliases section rewrite**: Replaced the "How arguments are routed" table with a concrete `fly deploy` example, restored the `up` rebase-every-worktree recipe, added a `since-main` example, and reorganized so the simpler "Passing values" section comes before the routing mechanism. ([#2304](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2304))

- **Trim filler in prose and help text**: Removed redundant qualifiers and parenthetical hedges across `extending.md`, `faq.md`, `tips-patterns.md`, and the `list` / `step` help text. ([#2277](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2277), [#2289](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2289))

- **Drop stale `[experimental]` from aliases docstring** ([#2283](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2283)) and **expand the worktrunk skill description with lexical triggers** so Claude finds it more reliably ([#2301](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2301)).

### Internal

- **Move approval handlers to config module**: Reflects the new `wt config approvals` home. ([#2286](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2286))

- **Nix flake reads Rust channel from `rust-toolchain.toml`**: Single source of truth instead of duplicating the toolchain version. ([#2188](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2188))

## 0.39.0

### Improved

- **Aliases dispatch from top-level `wt <name>`** (and graduate from experimental): Configured aliases now resolve as first-class commands — `wt deploy` works the same as `wt step deploy`, reading better as an everyday shortcut. Precedence is built-in → alias → `wt-<name>` PATH binary → unrecognized-subcommand error, matching git's model where `[alias]` entries shadow `git-foo` externals. The old "alias shadows a built-in" warning is gone; an alias named `commit` now simply runs via `wt commit` (only `wt step commit` remains shadowed). ([#2266](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2266))

- **`wt switch --base` accepts `pr:N` / `mr:N`**: `--base` now routes through the same resolver as the positional branch argument, so `wt switch -c feat-x --base pr:42` works symmetrically with `wt switch pr:42`. Same-repo PRs/MRs resolve to the source branch name; fork PRs/MRs fetch `refs/pull/N/head` (GitHub) or `refs/merge-requests/N/head` (GitLab) and use the resolved SHA, avoiding fork-branch pollution in the local namespace. ([#2263](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2263), thanks @jrdncstr for the request in [#2261](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2261))

- **`WORKTRUNK_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` env override**: Mirrors the existing `WORKTRUNK_CONFIG_PATH` (user) and `WORKTRUNK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` (system) overrides for the project config. Missing files at the overridden path resolve to no project config, same as a missing `.config/wt.toml`. `wt config show --format=json` now reports the overridden path in the `project.path` field. ([#2267](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2267))

### Fixed

- **`wt list` handles `[gone]` upstreams gracefully**: When a branch's configured upstream ref is gone (remote branch deleted, local tracking ref pruned), the Remote column was surfacing a raw `fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/<branch>'` error from `git rev-parse`. Upstream resolution now reads `%(upstream:track)` and treats `[gone]` the same as no upstream, so the row renders cleanly. ([#2262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2262))

- **Nix flake build with vendored skim-tuikit**: The `[patch.crates-io]` path dependency on `vendor/skim-tuikit` was being stubbed out by crane's `mkDummySrc` during `buildDepsOnly`, breaking downstream skim resolution. The flake now preserves real sources for vendored path deps while still benefiting from dependency caching. ([#2265](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2265), thanks @nickdichev)

### Documentation

- **Renamed "external subcommand" to "custom subcommand"**: The user-facing name for `wt-<name>` PATH-dispatched subcommands is now "custom subcommand" in docs and internal code, matching cargo's vocabulary. Avoids overloading "external," which the codebase already uses for `shell_exec` subprocesses. Internal renames: `src/commands/external.rs` → `custom.rs`, `Commands::External` → `Commands::Custom`. ([#2270](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2270))

- **Trimmed filler in prose docs**: Removed sentences that restated obvious error behavior, duplicated nearby prose, or added visual weight without information across `extending.md`, `faq.md`, and `tips-patterns.md`. ([#2271](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2271), [#2272](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2272))

### Internal

- Extracted a shared `did_you_mean` helper used by both top-level and `wt step` suggestion sites, so the 0.7 Jaro-Winkler threshold and sort order are defined in one place. ([#2268](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2268))

## 0.38.0

### Improved

- **Concurrent execution in `pre-*` pipeline hooks**: Pipeline blocks (`[[pre-start]]`, `[[pre-merge]]`, etc.) now run their concurrent commands in parallel for foreground hooks, matching the existing behavior in post-* hooks and aliases. The deprecated single-table form (`[pre-start]`) remains serial. ([#2249](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2249))

- **`cli` feature unbundles CLI-only deps for library consumers**: The `worktrunk` crate is also consumed as a library (e.g. by [`worktrunk-sync`](https://github.com/pablospe/worktrunk-sync)). Everything reachable from `src/lib.rs` previously pulled in `clap`, `clap_complete`, `skim`, `crossterm`, `termimad`, `env_logger`, and `humantime` transitively. A new `cli` feature (on by default) gates these; library consumers with `default-features = false` drop from 195 to 126 transitive crates. ([#2238](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2238))

- **Faster `wt list` and `wt switch` on warm caches**:

    - In-memory caches for remote URLs, commit details, and diff stats in `RepoCache` eliminate ~11 duplicate git subprocesses per `wt switch`. ([#2252](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2252))

    - `list_local_branches()` primes ref/SHA caches from `for-each-ref` data already collected; `Branch::upstream()` uses a single batch `for-each-ref` call instead of N per-branch `rev-parse` commands. Reduces `rev-parse` calls from 53 to 27 on a typical-8 benchmark. ([#2255](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2255))

    - Share `git status --porcelain` output between `WorkingTreeDiffTask` and `WorkingTreeConflictsTask`, halving duplicate subprocesses. ([#2259](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2259))

- **Faster `wt statusline`**: `terminal_width()` no longer walks parent processes to find a TTY — the fallback is now behind a dedicated helper used only by `wt statusline` under Claude Code. Picker, `wt list`, and help callers skip the walker entirely. ([#2260](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2260))

- **`switch.picker.timeout-ms` deprecated**: After progressive rendering landed in 0.37.1, this config field was parsed but silently ignored. It's now flagged as deprecated with migration via `wt config update`. (Breaking for library consumers: `SwitchPickerConfig::timeout_ms` field and `timeout()` accessor removed.) ([#2236](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2236))

### Fixed

- **Picker panic on terminal resize**: `Term::on_resize` panicked with `attempt to subtract with overflow` when the terminal was smaller than the picker's preferred height (reachable under `script(1)` with stdin closed, or in small tmux panes). Vendored skim-tuikit now uses `saturating_sub`. ([#2233](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2233))

- **Picker previews no longer show stale "no commits ahead" text**: BranchDiff/UpstreamDiff tabs read async fields that sometimes hadn't landed at skeleton-time precompute, caching wrong "has no commits ahead" / "has no upstream tracking branch" text. Previews now derive only from skeleton-time fields plus direct git queries. ([#2245](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2245))

- **Picker preview height with `--branches`/`--remotes`**: The Down-layout item count estimate only counted worktrees, so with `--branches` or `--remotes` the estimate underflowed and the preview claimed space the list needed. ([#2247](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2247))

- **GitLab CI status in `wt list`**: `glab ci list` now runs with the correct working directory. ([#2244](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2244))

- **Picker Summary tab empty state**: aligns with the other preview tabs (bullet + branch header) instead of a dimmed sentence. ([#2246](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2246))

### Documentation

- Use concurrent form in multi-key hook examples, now that pre-* concurrent is supported. ([#2248](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2248))

- Catalog skim 4.x upgrade impact and stability assessment. ([#2239](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2239))

- Picker and collect module docstrings gain phase timing tables and trace instrumentation at key picker phases. ([#2250](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2250))

### Internal

- Simplified `wt-perf` output; `cache-check` JSON adds wasted-time fields, sorts duplicates by wasted time, and renames `total_extra_calls` to `extra_calls`. ([#2253](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2253), [#2254](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2254))

## 0.37.1

### Improved

- **Progressive rendering in `wt switch` picker**: The picker now mirrors `wt list`'s skeleton-first model — branch and path render immediately, while status, diff stats, counts, and summaries fill in in place as they resolve. Replaces the previous ~500ms blocking freeze before first render. ([#2231](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2231))

- **Clean rows no longer flash the timeout glyph in the picker**: The LLM semaphore is now acquired only around the actual LLM call, so the no-changes and cache-hit fast paths return immediately instead of sitting behind up to 8 concurrent LLM calls. A clean `main` row in the picker now renders blank rather than the `·` "timed out" placeholder. ([#2222](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2222))

### Fixed

- **Picker preview styling bleed**: `color_print`'s `</>` emits SGR 22 to reset `<bold>`/`<dim>`, which skim 0.20's ANSI parser silently drops. Preview spans now emit an explicit full reset (`\x1b[0m`), so dim and bold no longer bleed across the rest of the preview pane. ([#2232](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2232))

- **Picker alt-screen enter/exit asymmetry**: In partial-height mode (`height=90%`), skim-tuikit skipped `smcup` on startup but still emitted `rmcup` on exit, corrupting the outer terminal's scrollback. The vendored tuikit now pairs enter/exit symmetrically. ([#2230](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2230))

- **Partial first render under tmux**: Under tmux PTY pressure, rows past the first ~1024 bytes would silently vanish because `Output::flush` used `write` instead of `write_all`. Vendored skim-tuikit fixes the short-write bug. ([#2226](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2226))

### Library

- **Expose worktree removal API from the `worktrunk` library**: `remove_worktree_with_cleanup`, `RemoveOptions`, and `BranchDeletionMode` are now public, letting external tools reuse the canonical removal flow (fsmonitor cleanup, trash-path staging) instead of reimplementing it with raw git commands. Motivated by [`worktrunk-sync`](https://github.com/pablospe/worktrunk-sync). ([#2227](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2227), thanks @pablospe for the request in [#2053](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2053))

### Documentation

- **Document `worktrunk-sync`**: Linked from the Extending page and the FAQ as a community-maintained companion tool for rebasing stacked worktree branches. ([#2225](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2225))

- **Catalog vendored skim patches**: `vendor/skim-tuikit/PATCHES.md` now records both landed and candidate patches against skim-tuikit, and a Cargo.toml comment records why skim is pinned to 0.20.x. ([#2228](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2228), [#2229](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2229))

### Internal

- **Drop unreachable `rayon::spawn` fallback** in the picker orchestrator. ([#2216](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2216))

## 0.37.0

### Improved

- **Concurrent table form across hooks and aliases**: `post-*` hooks already ran table form concurrently; aliases in table form (`[[aliases.deploy]]`) now do too, with output prefixed by a colored `{label} │ ` and line-atomic writes. `pre-*` table form (`[[pre-merge]]`) is still forced serial but will follow in a future release — it's deprecated now so the serial→concurrent switch is explicit. Run `wt config update` to migrate to pipeline form. ([#2089](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2089), [#2135](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2135), [#2145](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2145), [#2151](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2151))

- **`--KEY=VALUE` shorthand for alias and hook variables**: `wt step deploy --env=staging` and `wt hook pre-start --branch=feature/test` now work without the `--var` prefix. `--my-var=value` becomes `{{ my_var }}` in templates. Hooks also accept **custom variable names** (previously a fixed list; now matches alias behavior) and warn when a `--var` isn't referenced by any template — catching typos like `--brnach=feature`. ([#2091](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2091), [#2096](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2096), [#2117](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2117))

- **`wt step` discovers configured aliases**: Running `wt step` (or `wt step --help`) now lists user and project aliases alongside the built-in subcommands, each with a one-line template summary. Aliases that shadow a built-in are flagged `(shadowed by built-in)`. ([#2131](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2131), [#2141](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2141))

- **Shell completions for external `wt-*` subcommands**: Tab completion now discovers `wt-*` binaries on PATH and forwards completion requests to them, so `wt sync --<tab>` shows the external command's flags. Builds on the git-style external subcommand dispatch in 0.36.0. ([#2074](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2074), thanks @pablospe)

- **Persistent on-disk cache for expensive git operations**: Five SHA-keyed probes that previously ran live on every `wt list` and `wt switch` — merge-tree conflict checks, the integration/add-probe, `is-ancestor`, `has-added-changes`, and branch diff stats — are now cached to disk under `.git/wt/cache/`. Because commit SHAs are content-addressed, cached results never go stale; an LRU bound (5000 entries per kind) keeps disk usage bounded. User-visible effects:

    - **`wt list` and the `wt switch` picker open much faster on big repos**, especially those with many stale branches. A warm cache skips the expensive probes entirely; a cold cache still benefits from the faster per-worktree check below.

    - **Dirty-worktree conflict check is ~10× faster on cold cache.** Swapped `git stash create` for `git write-tree` as the ephemeral tree snapshot — same answer, far less plumbing per worktree. ([#2119](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2119))

    - **The picker now shows the same status info as `wt list`.** The old "skip stale branches" shortcut hid conflict and ahead/behind info on branches 50+ commits behind main to keep the picker responsive. The cache makes the shortcut unnecessary, so stale branches now display full status.

    - **Consistent results during in-progress rebases.** Tasks now track the branch ref rather than the worktree's transient HEAD, so rows no longer contradict themselves mid-rebase (e.g., `is_ancestor=true` alongside `1 ahead / 1 behind`).

    Cache is cleared by `wt config state clear`. ([#2085](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2085), [#2090](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2090), [#2098](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2098), [#2119](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2119))

- **Lower-priority background operations**: Extends the CPU/IO priority throttling already used by `wt step copy-ignored` to the background `rm -rf` in `wt remove` and the trash sweep, so cleanup doesn't compete with foreground work. On macOS this now uses `taskpolicy -b`, which throttles disk I/O as well as CPU; Linux uses `nice -n 19` with best-effort `ionice`. User hooks are unchanged. ([#2130](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2130), [#2133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2133))

- **Pipeline structure in alias announcements**: Aliases now announce their pipeline structure: `Running alias deploy: install; build, lint` rather than the bare alias name. ([#2092](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2092))

- **Graceful per-layer config degradation**: A bad env var or a broken user config file no longer wipes the entire config to defaults. Each layer (system, user, env vars) degrades independently — valid layers apply, invalid layers are skipped with a warning. ([#2120](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2120))

- **Per-variable env var type resolution**: When multiple `WORKTRUNK_*` env vars target fields of different types (e.g., a numeric and a string field), each is resolved independently against the file config. Previously one incompatible var would drop every env override and the file config. ([#2111](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2111))

- **Clearer deprecation warnings**: Structural deprecation warnings follow a consistent `{label}: X is deprecated in favor of Y` pattern with a single proposed-diff preview — no more redundant current-config dump. Template variable renames and the `approved-commands` removal use the same pattern. Every command (not just `wt config show`) now emits the same per-kind warnings, with a single dedup'd hint per process pointing to `wt config show` for details and `wt config update` to apply. Deprecation warnings are suppressed in non-diagnostic contexts (tab completion, picker, `wt list statusline`) to keep prompts quiet. ([#2147](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2147), [#2148](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2148), [#2153](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2153), [#2171](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2171))

- **Structured JSON for `wt config state logs`**: `--format` is now a global flag on `state logs`, `state hints`, `state ci-status`, and `state marker` — ordering no longer matters. Logs JSON entries gain first-class `branch`, `source`, `hook_type`, `name`, `size`, `modified_at`, and absolute `path` fields alongside the existing relative `file`, so filtering works with `jq` directly. (Breaking: the `--hook` and `--branch` filters on `wt config state logs get` were removed in favor of `jq`; piping the JSON through `jq 'select(.branch == "...")'` replaces them.) ([#2156](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2156), [#2161](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2161))

- **Cleaner log filenames**: Background hook log files skip the collision-avoidance hash suffix when the input is already a safe filename. `main/project/post-merge/clippy.log` instead of `main-vfz/project/post-merge/clippy-vif.log`. Names containing invalid path characters still get the hash. ([#2157](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2157))

- **`wt list` stall visibility**: When `wt list` hangs for 5+ seconds, the progressive footer now names the blocked task and worktree (e.g. `○ Showing 13 worktrees (253/254 loaded, no recent progress; waiting on ci-status for feat)`), with a pending count when multiple tasks are outstanding. On full timeout, the warning joins the blocked-tasks list onto a single gutter-prefixed line: `▲ wt list timed out after 120s (151 results received); blocked tasks: …`. ([#2203](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2203), [#2205](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2205), [#2207](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2207))

- **`-vv` logs full subprocess output to disk; drop `-vvv`**: Captured subprocess stdout/stderr now fan out to two log targets — a bounded preview on stderr mirrored to `.git/wt/logs/trace.log` (renamed from `verbose.log`), and the uncapped body to a new `.git/wt/logs/output.log`. Large captures (e.g. `git log -p | patch-id` during `wt list`) no longer flood stderr with elision markers and force a rerun — the full body is always on disk. Any `-v` count above 2 collapses to `-vv`. ([#2201](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2201))

- **Clap-native errors for unrecognized subcommands**: `wt s` and `wt step sqush` now show clap's formatted `error: unrecognized subcommand 'X'` with typo suggestions and Usage block, rather than a custom git-style single-line message. The `#[command(external_subcommand)]` path added in 0.36.0 for `wt-<name>` dispatch is preserved. ([#2212](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2212), [#2215](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2215))

- **Quieter `wt list` loading placeholders**: The `·` loading indicator no longer appears for commands that finish within 200ms — short renders never flash the dots. The Status column's loading/timeout glyph collapses from `⋯` to a dim `·`, and the working-tree gate's loading placeholder collapses from `···` to a single `·`, matching the visual weight of neighbouring gates. ([#2177](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2177), [#2181](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2181), [#2199](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2199))

- **Fewer `wt list statusline` subprocesses**: Statusline rendering dropped four duplicate git subprocesses per render (`rev-parse --git-common-dir` ×2, `--show-toplevel` ×3, `--git-dir` ×2) by adding a process-wide `rev-parse --git-common-dir` cache and canonicalizing input paths in `Repository::worktree_at()`. ([#2209](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2209))

- **Signals named in background pipeline errors**: Killed hook children now report which signal: `pipeline step terminated by signal 15 (SIGTERM): <step>` instead of the generic `command failed with signal`. ([#2193](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2193))

- **Nested config typos surface as warnings**: Mistyped keys nested inside a known table (e.g. `[merge] squas = true`) now produce `Unknown field merge.squas` rather than going unnoticed. Built on a unified top-level + nested unknown-key analysis that also powers on-save preservation. ([#2195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2195))

- **`sanitize_hash` minijinja filter**: New template filter that wraps `sanitize_for_filename` — produces a filesystem-safe name with a 3-char hash suffix so distinct originals never collide, while already-safe inputs pass through unchanged. Useful for matching on-disk hook log filenames from `wt config state logs --format=json`. ([#2172](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2172))

### Fixed

- **`wt --help` and `wt --version` write to stdout**: Both previously wrote to stderr, breaking `version=$(wt --version)` and pipelines like `wt --help | grep …`. If you have scripts redirecting `2>&1` as a workaround, drop the redirect. Fixes [#2072](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2072). ([#2073](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2073), thanks @koralowiec for reporting; [#2155](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2155))

- **Directive file passes through `wt step` aliases**: Inside a `wt step <alias>` body, an inner `wt switch --create` now writes its `cd` directive to the parent shell instead of dropping it. This was the last blocker for "move staged changes into a new worktree" alias recipes. ([#2077](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2077))

- **Detect `AA` and `DD` unmerged status codes**: The working-tree conflict check caught 5 of 7 unmerged states but missed `AA` (both added) and `DD` (both deleted). Worktrees with these conflict types now fall back to the commit-based check as intended. ([#2124](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2124))

- **Squash detection no longer silently misses branches when `git diff-tree` fails**: The patch-id pipeline used for squash-merge detection didn't check whether `git diff-tree` exited cleanly — a failed source command fed `git patch-id` a truncated stream, producing a bogus patch-id and reporting "not squashed" when the branch may have been. Pipeline now bails on source-exit non-zero, and streams directly between commands via an OS pipe rather than buffering in-process. ([#2136](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2136))

- **Nushell multi-line `--execute` payloads**: The nushell wrapper was executing the exec directive file line-by-line, so multi-line payloads ran as separate shell sessions — `cd` and variable assignments didn't persist across lines. Now matches bash/zsh/fish `source` semantics. ([#2134](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2134))

- **Redundant "To configure" hint for outdated shell wrappers**: When a shell's integration file exists but is stale, `wt config show` no longer prints both a specific `wt config shell install <shell>` hint and the generic "To configure" summary. The summary now appears only when a shell is genuinely not configured. ([#2152](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2152))

- **Ctrl-C aborts `wt` command loops**: Signal-derived child exits (SIGINT/SIGTERM) now abort hook pipelines, alias steps, concurrent groups, and the `wt step for-each` worktree loop. Previously, wt's signal handler forwarded SIGINT/SIGTERM to the current child but wt itself survived, and `FailureStrategy::Warn` silently swallowed each interrupt — a single Ctrl-C against `wt merge` could charge through remaining hook steps. ([#2174](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2174), [#2182](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2182))

- **Nested unknown config keys preserved on save**: Any unknown key nested inside a known table (e.g. `future-option = true` under `[merge]`) was silently deleted on any config save triggered by other mutations (first-run prompt, interactive path customization). Preservation is now computed recursively, so unknown keys survive at every nesting level. ([#2180](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2180))

- **`wt step --help` honors `-C` and `--config`**: Help previously resolved aliases before applying global flags, so `wt -C other step --help` listed aliases from the process cwd and `--config custom.toml` was ignored. Globals are now parsed in a single early pass. ([#2176](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2176))

- **`wt step --help` no longer triggers config side effects**: Rendering the alias listing in help output no longer emits deprecation warnings to stderr or writes a migration file next to the user config. ([#2179](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2179))

- **`wt step <alias> --dry-run` with lazy vars**: Dry-run previously expanded every command eagerly, so pipelines that read `{{ vars.foo }}` set by an earlier step failed with an "undefined vars" error even when the non-dry-run command would succeed. Dry-run now mirrors the hook pattern: templates that reference `vars.*` are syntax-validated (catching typos like `{{ vars..foo }}`) and shown raw, while other templates expand eagerly. ([#2170](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2170))

- **`wt config show` fish completions and false-negative gating**: A missing fish completions file used to print a confusing nested hint under "Already configured shell extension" and flip the generic "To configure" summary. It now prints a warning with specific remediation, mirroring the "Outdated shell extension" pattern. The "report a false negative" link is no longer gated on `!has_any_configured`, so a detector miss in one shell still offers the link when other shells are detected. ([#2163](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2163))

- **Nix build meets Rust 1.93 MSRV**: `flake.lock` updated to ship a newer nixpkgs rustc. ([#2185](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2185), thanks @Lysanleo)

### Documentation

- **"Extending Worktrunk" page**: Dedicated docs page collecting recipes for custom workflows via hooks and aliases, including a "move staged changes to a new worktree" recipe closing [#938](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/938). ([#2079](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2079), [#2083](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2083), [#2088](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2088), [#2094](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2094))

- **OpenCode in agent handoffs**: Skill documentation now covers OpenCode alongside other agent CLIs. ([#2108](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2108), thanks @vinicius507 for the suggestion in [#2076](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2076))

- **Hook pipeline documentation**: `wt hook --help` and web docs now teach pipelines as `[[hook]]` blocks with TOML notes in `config commands`, and the aliases docs teach `[[aliases.NAME]]` pipeline blocks. ([#2144](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2144), [#2149](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2149), [#2154](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2154))

- **FAQ updates**: Qualified the "no background processes" claim; clarified coverage includes shell-integration-tests; config key location uses `git config worktrunk.*`. ([#2080](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2080), [#2086](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2086), [#2126](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2126))

- **Troubleshooting: `wt list` fsmonitor hang**: Noted the interaction with core.fsmonitor daemons. ([#2194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2194))

- **README installation command formatting**: Fixed code-block formatting around installation commands. ([#2187](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2187), thanks @MahmoudMabrok)

### Internal

- **Shell wrapper directive file split**: The shell integration now writes `cd` paths to a separate file from `--execute` shell payloads, with the `cd` path read literally (`cd -- "$(< file)"`, no shell parsing) and the exec file scrubbed from alias and hook child environments. Hardens against shell injection from hook/alias bodies into the parent session. The legacy single-file form is honored through 0.38; nushell users need `wt config shell install` to pick up the new wrapper. ([#2118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2118))

- **MSRV bumped to Rust 1.93**: Per the "latest stable − 1" policy. ([#2125](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2125))

- **Centralized `[wt-trace]` emitter**: Trace records are now owned by `src/trace/emit.rs` rather than ad-hoc `log::debug!` format strings, and `-vv` log verbosity is fixed. ([#2146](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2146))

- **Unified hook and alias execution paths**: Hooks and aliases share the same foreground execution, shell invocation, template expansion, and priority-spawning code. ([#2089](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2089), [#2128](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2128), [#2140](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2140), [#2095](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2095), [#2113](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2113))

- **Config migration is now in-memory; no more `.new` files**: `wt config show` renders the deprecation diff from in-memory migrated content rather than writing a `.new` file next to the user's config. `wt config update` owns the sole filesystem mutation; a new `--print` flag emits migrated TOML to stdout without writing. ([#2184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2184))

## 0.36.0

### Improved

- **Git-style external subcommands**: `wt foo` now runs `wt-foo` from PATH when `foo` is not a built-in, mirroring `git foo` → `git-foo`. Third-party tools can be installed and invoked as `wt <name>` without touching this repo. Unrecognized commands show a git-style error with typo suggestions. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/tips-patterns/#external-subcommands) ([#2054](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2054), thanks @pablospe for the suggestion in [#2053](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2053))

- **`{{ owner }}` template variable**: Expands to the GitHub/GitLab repository owner, useful for constructing URLs or paths in hook templates and `worktree-path`. ([#2051](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2051), thanks @greggdonovan)

- **Typed env-var config overrides**: `WORKTRUNK__LIST__TIMEOUT_MS=30` and other typed overrides now work correctly. Previously, string-typed env values silently failed deserialization, wiping all user config and falling back to defaults. ([#2062](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2062))

- **Config error attribution**: Config load errors now identify the source — file errors show TOML line/column pointers, env-var errors list the offending `WORKTRUNK_*` variable. Previously all failures showed a generic message. ([#2068](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2068))

- **Per-symbol atomic status rendering**: The Status column in `wt list` and the `wt switch` picker now renders each symbol independently — unresolved gates show `⋯` at their position instead of fabricating defaults when the collect deadline expires. ([#2067](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2067))

- **Hook error messages**: Malformed hook command config now lists the three accepted forms (string, named table, pipeline list) with a pointer to `wt hook --help`, instead of an opaque serde error. ([#2042](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2042))

- **Stale trash cleanup**: `wt remove` now sweeps orphaned `.git/wt/trash` entries older than 24 hours after each removal, reclaiming space from interrupted background removals. ([#2039](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2039))

### Changed

- **`wt hook <type>` exits successfully when no hooks are configured**: Previously errored; now prints a warning and exits 0, so scripts and CI can invoke `wt hook` unconditionally. ([#2056](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2056))

- **Hook output log layout**: Log files moved from flat `.git/wt/logs/{name}.log` to nested `{branch}/{source}/{hook-type}/{name}.log`. Per-branch listing/clearing is now O(that branch). `logs get --format=json` paths changed to relative. Legacy flat files are swept automatically. ([#2041](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2041))

### Fixed

- **`wt config show` false "Not configured"**: When the shell init line lives in a sourced file (common with dotfile managers), `config show` no longer reports "Not configured" — it checks whether integration is actually active at runtime. Fixes [#1306](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1306). ([#2066](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2066), thanks @wouter-intveld for reporting)

- **Remove-then-switch hint**: The hint for shadowed remote branches now uses `--foreground` so the chained `wt remove && wt switch` actually works (background removal left a placeholder directory blocking the switch). ([#2040](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2040))

- **Conflict detection unified**: The `wt switch` picker and `wt list` now both run both conflict probes (commit-level and working-tree). Previously the picker skipped the cheaper probe, leaving the fallback unreachable for clean worktrees; `wt list` non-full skipped the working-tree probe, missing conflicts from interrupted rebases. ([#2064](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2064))

### Documentation

- Surfaced vars & aliases on homepage and tips-patterns, cross-linked state keys to dedicated docs, tightened hook links. ([#2035](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2035), [#2036](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2036), [#2037](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2037), [#2038](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2038))

### Internal

- Subcommand ordering aligned to documented policies (pipeline order for step, CRUD for state actions). ([#2043](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2043), [#2044](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2044))

## 0.35.3

### Improved

- **`wt step prune` streams removals inline**: Removals and "Skipped" messages now print as each integration check completes, overlapping with still-running checks — previously there was a visible gap of silence while all parallel checks finished before any output appeared. ([#2015](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2015))

- **Fewer redundant `git worktree list` calls in prune and multi-remove**: `prepare_worktree_removal()` now accepts a pre-fetched worktree list, eliminating N+1 subprocess calls when removing many worktrees. ([#2025](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2025))

### Fixed

- **Picker preview UI lag**: The picker's preview cache now stores pager-rendered output, so cache hits skip the pager subprocess entirely. Previously, scrolling past an item with a large diff froze the UI briefly on every re-render because the pager ran on every call. ([#2021](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2021))

- **Template error hint underlining**: The "Available variables" hint in template expansion errors now underlines each variable name individually instead of wrapping the entire comma-separated list in a single underline span. ([#2028](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2028))

### Documentation

- **Cross-linked vars references**: The vars feature is documented in the hook template variables table, `wt config state vars` page, and tips-patterns recipes — these now link to each other so readers can navigate between "how to set" and "how to use in templates". ([#2034](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2034))

- **Clearer project config intro**: Improved the project config introduction and template variable heading in `wt config` help text. ([#2032](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2032))

## 0.35.2

### Improved

- **Multiple NAME filters for hook subcommands**: `wt hook pre-merge --yes insta doctest doc` runs a subset of hooks in one command, instead of chaining separate invocations. ([#2013](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2013))

- **Branch context in batch removal hooks**: During prune or multi-remove, hook announcement messages now include the branch name (`Running post-remove for **branch-name**: project:cleanup`), disambiguating which worktree triggered each hook. ([#2014](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2014))

### Fixed

- **Bare repo false positive when `core.bare` is unset**: Repos cloned by Eclipse/EGit (and other tools that don't write `core.bare`) were incorrectly detected as bare. Replaced `git rev-parse --is-bare-repository` with `git config --type=bool core.bare`. Fixes [#1939](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1939). ([#1976](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1976), thanks @daniel-iwan-datacore for reporting)

## 0.35.1

### Fixed

- **PR lookup on forks respects `gh repo set-default`**: `wt switch pr:N` now checks the gh-configured default repo when origin points to a fork, instead of always querying the fork's repo (which returns 404). The error message is also context-aware based on the configured default. Fixes [#2002](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2002). ([#2004](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2004), thanks @JustinPierce for reporting)

- **JSON output stability**: `config show --format=json` log file sort is now deterministic (filename tiebreaker for identical timestamps). `step for-each --format=json` includes a consistent `error` field on all failure variants. ([#2001](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2001))

### Internal

- Continued `TestRepo` consolidation: `bare()` constructor, `at(path)` constructor, removed lifetime guard field. ([#2000](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2000), [#2005](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2005), [#2007](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/2007))

## 0.35.0

### Improved

- **`--no-verify` deprecated in favor of `--no-hooks`**: All commands (`switch`, `remove`, `merge`, `step commit`, `step squash`) now use `--no-hooks`. `--no-verify` remains as a hidden alias with a deprecation warning. ([#1932](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1932))

- **JSON output**: `--format=json` on `config show`, `config state` subcommands, `switch`, `remove`, `merge`, `step prune`, and `step for-each`. ([#1969](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1969), [#1959](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1959))

- **Per-command hook log files**: Each background hook command writes to its own log file instead of sharing a pipeline log. Combined hook announcements (e.g., post-remove + post-switch) display on a single status line. ([#1934](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1934), [#1980](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1980))

- **Prune and list performance**: `step prune` streams integration checks and removes candidates in parallel (~3x faster on repos with many branches). Multiple caching layers (integration target, `git_dir`, `rev_parse_tree`, `resolve_preferring_branch`) reduce redundant `git rev-parse` calls during `wt list`. ([#1950](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1950), [#1957](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1957), [#1966](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1966), [#1948](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1948), [#1943](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1943))

- **Itemized `state clear` output**: `wt config state clear` shows per-category counts and cleans up stale trash from incomplete worktree removals. ([#1961](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1961), [#1960](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1960))

- **Hook pipeline summary**: Serial steps separated by `;` instead of `→`, repeated unnamed sources collapsed into counted form (`user ×2`), and named steps show `source:name` prefix. ([#1994](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1994))

- **Copy-pasteable help text**: `--help` output strips `$ ` prompts from code examples for direct copy-paste in the terminal. ([#1992](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1992))

- **Better PR lookup errors**: `wt switch pr:N` 404 errors now include the repository name and suggest `gh repo set-default` for fork workflows. Fixes [#1925](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1925). ([#1927](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1927), thanks @JustinPierce for reporting)

- **Claude Code worktree hooks**: WorktreeCreate and WorktreeRemove hooks for the Claude Code plugin. ([#1959](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1959))

### Fixed

- **File permissions lost on copy-ignored**: `wt step copy-ignored` now preserves execute bits when copying files via reflink. Fixes [#1936](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1936). ([#1937](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1937), thanks @RileyMathews for reporting)

- **Git alias breaks `wt`**: Relative `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` paths inherited from git aliases now normalized to absolute paths at startup. Fixes [#1914](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1914). ([#1915](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1915), thanks @yasuhiroki for reporting)

- **Diagnostic files in state logs**: `verbose.log` and `diagnostic.md` now properly categorized in `wt config state logs` output. ([#1981](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1981))

- **Integration target in removal display**: Background removal now shows `origin/main` (effective target) instead of `main` when the remote is ahead. ([#1993](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1993))

- **Worktree-path hint suppression**: The "customize worktree locations" hint no longer appears when project-specific `worktree-path` is configured. ([#1941](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1941))

- **State logs formatting**: Missing newline between log sections in `wt config state logs` output. ([#1968](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1968))

- **Claude Code WorktreeCreate hook**: Fixed jq filter using wrong input field. ([#1964](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1964))

- **OpenCode unicode escaping**: Fixed broken emoji markers depending on Bun version. ([#1935](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1935), thanks @noirbizarre)

### Documentation

- Clarified plugin install command. ([#1906](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1906), thanks @suyua9)
- Fixed inaccurate logs documentation. ([#1986](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1986))

### Internal

- Consolidated `TestRepo` into single `src/testing` module, shared across lib and bin unit tests. ([#1944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1944), [#1963](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1963), [#1971](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1971), [#1991](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1991))
- Simplified dispatch, timeout, and copy pool internals. ([#1949](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1949), [#1930](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1930), [#1931](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1931))

## 0.34.2

### Improved

- **OpenCode integration**: Activity tracking plugin shows agent status (`🤖` working, `💬` waiting) in `wt list`, with `wt config plugins opencode install/uninstall` for management. Also adds OpenCode as an LLM commit generation backend. ([#1807](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1807), thanks @noirbizarre)

- **Lower priority for copy-ignored**: `wt step copy-ignored` now runs at the lowest OS scheduling priority (`renice -n 19`), yielding CPU to interactive foreground tasks on large trees. ([#1916](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1916))

- **Diff stats performance**: Switched from `--numstat` (one line per file) to `--shortstat` (single summary line), reducing diff output from O(files) to O(1) per worktree. ([#1917](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1917))

### Fixed

- **Remote detection with `includeIf` config**: `primary_remote()` failed when non-remote git config keys (like `includeIf.hasconfig:remote.*.url`) matched the remote regex. ([#1908](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1908), thanks @nirvdrum)

- **Background hook execution**: Fixed three issues — list-form configs lost serial/concurrent semantics in post-merge/post-remove hooks, pipeline `hook_name` context leaked across steps, and lazy template expansion was broken for name-filtered hooks (e.g., `wt hook post-start db`). ([#1910](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1910))

- **Copy-ignored parallelism**: The outer loop in `wt step copy-ignored` ran on the global rayon pool instead of the dedicated copy pool, effectively serializing top-level entries. Now runs entirely on the 4-thread copy pool. ([#1913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1913))

- **Windows stack overflow in copy-ignored**: Copy pool worker threads used platform default stack size (~2 MiB on Windows), causing overflow with 200+ directories. Now uses explicit 8 MiB stack size across all platforms. ([#1911](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1911))

- **Nix flake build**: Fixed `flake.nix` filtering out the `dev/` directory, which broke builds after OpenCode integration added `include_str!("../../../dev/opencode-plugin.ts")`. ([#1924](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1924), thanks @mariuskimmina)

### Internal

- Unified background hook execution into a single pipeline-based path, removing ~260 lines of dual-path branching. ([#1912](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1912))
- Replaced deprecated `codecov/test-results-action` with `codecov/codecov-action`. ([#1918](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1918))
- Bumped AUR deploy action to v4.1.2 (fixes argument order with Arch Linux's updated `runuser`). ([#1909](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1909))

## 0.34.1

### Improved

- **`step prune` performance**: Integration checks now run in parallel, dramatically reducing prune time for repos with many branches (3+ minutes → seconds with 100+ branches). Fixes [#1888](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1888). ([#1890](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1890), thanks @ortonomy for reporting)

### Fixed

- **CPU saturation during copy operations**: Restored a dedicated 4-thread copy pool that was accidentally removed in v0.34.0, preventing ~1000% CPU usage on copy-heavy operations like `step copy-ignored`. ([#1905](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1905))

- **Background pipeline template variables**: When `wt switch --create` fires both post-switch and post-start hooks, pipeline steps were incorrectly accumulated into a single background process, causing `{{ hook_type }}` to expand to the wrong value. Each hook type now spawns its own pipeline. ([#1904](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1904))

### Internal

- Extracted shared `classify_unknown_key` to deduplicate config warning logic. ([#1902](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1902))

## 0.34.0

### Improved

- **Per-branch custom variables**: New `wt config state vars set/get/list/clear` commands store custom key-value pairs per branch, accessible as `{{ vars.key }}` in hook templates and `wt step eval`. Variables persist in git config and appear in `wt list --format=json`. ([#1006](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1006))

- **Lazy template expansion in pipelines**: Pipeline steps now expand `{{ vars.* }}` at execution time rather than at pipeline construction, so variables set by step N are available in step N+1. ([#1840](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1840))

- **`wt config plugins claude` commands**: New `install`, `uninstall`, and `install-statusline` subcommands manage Claude Code integration. `install` registers the worktrunk plugin via the Claude marketplace, `install-statusline` configures the Claude Code status line, and `wt config show` suggests these commands instead of raw CLI instructions. ([#1830](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1830), [#1834](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1834))

- **`[forge]` config section**: New explicit `[forge]` section with `platform` and `hostname` fields for SSH host aliases and non-standard remotes. `ci.platform` is deprecated with automatic migration. ([#1826](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1826))

- **Forge detection with `url.insteadOf`**: Forge platform detection now falls back to the effective URL (after git `url.insteadOf` rewrites), fixing CI status, PR/MR detection, and push-remote features for users with SSH aliases or corporate mirrors. ([#1771](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1771), thanks @amodelaweb; thanks @roytouw for reporting [#1790](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1790))

- **`--branch` flag for `wt step commit`**: Commit to a specific branch without switching to it — useful in automation and scripts. ([#1750](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1750))

- **Last fetch time in branch-not-found hint**: When `wt switch` can't find a branch, the hint now shows when the remote was last fetched (e.g., "last fetched 3h ago") to help identify stale local refs. ([#1877](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1877))

- **Config field renames**: `merge.no-ff` → `merge.ff` and `switch.no-cd` → `switch.cd`, using positive-sense naming. Old names continue to work with deprecation warnings and automatic migration via `wt config update`. ([#1856](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1856), [#1860](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1860))

- **Syntax highlighting for template blocks**: Documentation site now renders `{{ }}` template expressions with syntax highlighting. ([#1792](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1792))

- **Hide Claude Code section when CLI unavailable**: `wt config show` no longer displays the Claude Code integration section if the `claude` CLI is not found. ([#1827](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1827))

### Fixed

- **Copy-ignored too many open files**: `wt step copy-ignored` could exhaust file descriptors on large trees. Now reuses a single thread pool across all copy operations. Fixes [#1865](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1865). ([#1864](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1864), thanks @fspeirs)

- **Squash-merged branch detection with merge-tree conflicts**: `wt step prune` and `wt list` failed to detect squash-merged branches when the default branch modified the same files. Now uses patch-id matching as fallback. Fixes [#1818](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1818). ([#1820](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1820), thanks @tthyer for reporting)

- **Background removal blocked for 1 second**: `wt remove` blocked unnecessarily due to incorrect shell operator precedence in the background process spawn. ([#1858](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1858))

- **Fish shell getcwd error in Zellij**: Removing a worktree while using fish in Zellij produced "error retrieving current directory" messages. ([#1787](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1787))

- **Alias detection false positive on path substrings**: `wt config show` incorrectly flagged unrelated aliases when the alias target path contained "wt" as a substring. Fixes [#1772](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1772). ([#1773](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1773), thanks @nicolasff for reporting)

- **Branch names with dots in vars**: Vars parsing incorrectly split branch names containing dots (e.g., `release.1.0`) as nested config keys. ([#1837](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1837))

- **Lazy pipeline vars expansion in background hooks**: Background hook execution failed with lazy vars expansion due to raw string quoting and overly strict template validation. ([#1855](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1855))

- **GitLab MR remote tracking**: `wt switch mr:N` could reuse branches tracking the correct merge-request ref but on the wrong remote. ([#1817](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1817))

- **Fork CI and integration target detection**: Fixed CI check-runs querying the wrong repo for forks, branch tracking checking only merge config, and diverged local branches missing remote merges. ([#1812](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1812))

- **Placeholder directory on non-current worktree removal**: `wt remove` created unnecessary empty placeholder directories and slept for 1 second when removing worktrees other than the current one. ([#1868](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1868), [#1874](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1874))

- **Merge-tree errors silently swallowed**: `git merge-tree` failures (invalid refs, corrupt repos) were treated as conflicts instead of propagating, triggering expensive patch-id fallback unnecessarily. ([#1896](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1896))

- **Deprecated key in wrong config file**: A deprecated section key (e.g., `[commit-generation]`) in the wrong config file (e.g., project config) was silently filtered. Now warns "Key X belongs in Y config as Z". ([#1899](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1899))

- **Config migration mutex panic**: Replaced unsafe `unwrap()` with error propagation in config deprecation migration. ([#1887](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1887))

- **Hook show outside git repo**: `wt hook show` now provides a clear error message when run outside a git repository. ([#1809](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1809), thanks @noirbizarre)

### Documentation

- Help text rewritten for `switch`, `merge`, `hook`, and `remove` commands. ([#1782](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1782), [#1783](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1783), [#1785](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1785), [#1765](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1765), [#1764](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1764))

- Hook documentation restructured: types reordered by paired events, pipeline ordering rewritten with progressive examples, approval prompt shown in color. ([#1763](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1763), [#1756](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1756), [#1766](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1766))

- Hooks documented in user config reference. ([#1845](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1845))

- Deprecated `post-create` removed from documentation. ([#1776](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1776))

- Arch Linux official package added to installation instructions. ([#1872](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1872), thanks @ctrl-q)

- README template syntax fixed. Fixes [#1851](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1851). ([#1852](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1852), thanks @IlyaSemenov for reporting)

### Internal

- Config deprecation consolidated from two layers to one pre-deserialization TOML migration. ([#1879](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1879), [#1880](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1880), [#1876](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1876))

- Benchmark infrastructure extracted into `wt-perf` crate. ([#1878](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1878))

- `wt remove` approval path reuses already-loaded repo/config (~50ms savings). ([#1875](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1875))

### Deprecated

| Old | New | Action |
|-----|-----|--------|
| `[ci]` section | `[forge]` section | `wt config update` migrates; `wt config show` warns |
| `no-ff` in `[merge]` | `ff` (reversed) | `wt config update` migrates; `wt config show` warns |
| `no-cd` in `[switch]` | `cd` (reversed) | `wt config update` migrates; `wt config show` warns |

All deprecated fields continue to work. Run `wt config update` to migrate, or `wt config show` for details.

## 0.33.0

### Improved

- **Hook execution pipelines**: Post-* hooks support TOML array syntax for serial dependencies — steps execute in order, with maps within steps running concurrently. `post-start = [{ install = "npm install" }, { build = "npm run build", lint = "npm run lint" }]` runs install first, then build and lint in parallel. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1713](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1713))

- **Copy-ignored exclude patterns**: `wt step copy-ignored` now skips built-in VCS metadata and tool-state directories (`.bzr/`, `.conductor/`, `.entire/`, `.hg/`, `.jj/`, `.pi/`, `.pijul/`, `.sl/`, `.svn/`, `.worktrees/`) by default. Additional excludes are configurable via `[step.copy-ignored] exclude = [...]` in user or project config. ([#1667](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1667), thanks @shunkakinoki for [#1653](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1653))

- **Copy-ignored parallelized**: `wt step copy-ignored` directory walks run in parallel with a dedicated 4-thread pool, improving performance on multi-core systems. ([#1721](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1721))

- **Alias append semantics**: Aliases now use append semantics across all config layers, matching hook merge behavior. Within user config, per-project aliases append to global aliases on collision (global first). Across configs, project-config aliases also run alongside user aliases (user first, then project with approval) — previously the user version silently suppressed the project version. ([#1724](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1724), [#1727](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1727))

- **Agent skill discovery**: The website now serves `.well-known/agent-skills/` for web-based skill discovery by AI agents. ([#1751](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1751))

### Fixed

- **Picker alt-r skipped remove hooks**: Removing a worktree via `alt-r` in the picker bypassed pre-remove and post-remove hooks. Pre-remove hooks now run synchronously (non-zero exit aborts removal), and post-remove hooks spawn in the background. ([#1710](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1710))

- **False positive shell integration warning**: `wt config show` reported "Found wt in ... but not detected as integration" for Nushell and Fish wrapper files that ARE the integration. Fixes [#1735](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1735). ([#1736](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1736), thanks @saschabratton)

- **Bare repo config path ignored**: `wt hook approvals add` and other config commands failed to find `.config/wt.toml` in bare repositories because they looked relative to the current worktree instead of the primary worktree. Fixes [#1744](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1744). ([#1745](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1745), thanks @jrdncstr)

### Documentation

- Help text for `wt step` subcommands cleaned up — redundant openers removed. ([#1737](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1737))

- Experimental badge placement fixed in generated documentation. ([#1742](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1742), [#1729](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1729), [#1734](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1734), [#1746](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1746))

### Internal

- Copy-ignored built-in exclude constants consolidated. ([#1738](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1738))

- `Cmd::env()` accepts `AsRef<OsStr>` for direct path compatibility. ([#1723](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1723))

- Picker width survey snapshots for layout testing at various terminal sizes. ([#1613](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1613))

## 0.32.0

### Improved

- **Hooks rationalized**: Every lifecycle event now has a symmetric `pre-` (blocking) / `post-` (background) pair. This required one rename: `post-create` → `pre-start`, reflecting that it runs *before* `post-start` as a blocking dependency step. A new `post-commit` hook fires in the background after commits (including squash commits during merge). `post-merge` is now background instead of blocking, consistent with all other `post-*` hooks. Configs using `post-create` get a deprecation warning on any `wt` command; run `wt config update` to rename automatically. The old name continues to work during the deprecation period. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1679](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1679), closes [#1670](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1670), thanks @ortonomy for reporting [#1571](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1571))

- **Detached worktree support**: Detached HEAD worktrees can now be removed via `wt remove /path/to/worktree` and switched to via `wt switch /path/to/worktree`. The interactive picker also handles detached worktrees for both operations. ([#1665](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1665), [#1680](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1680), thanks @mjakl for reporting [#1661](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1661))

- **In-place worktree removal in picker**: Press `alt-r` in the `wt switch` picker to remove the selected worktree without leaving the picker. Currently hidden from picker legend and help text pending a cursor-reset issue ([#1695](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1695)). ([#1677](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1677), [#1696](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1696))

- **Smarter column dropping in `wt list`**: Low-priority columns (Message, Time, Commit) are now dropped when Summary needs more space, using graduated thresholds based on priority distance. Extends the no-data column dropping from v0.31.0. ([#1678](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1678))

### Fixed

- **Bare repo project config ignored**: `.config/wt.toml` placed in the primary worktree of a bare repository was not found when running commands from the bare repo root directory. Config is now loaded from the primary worktree as fallback, and accidental config in the bare repo root itself is skipped. Fixes [#1691](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1691). ([#1692](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1692), [#1697](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1697), thanks @seakayone)

- **`pre-start` hook failure was non-blocking**: `pre-start` was the only `pre-*` hook that warned on failure instead of aborting. All `pre-*` hooks now consistently use FailFast. (Breaking: `pre-start` hook failures that previously only warned now abort the operation.) ([#1708](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1708))

- **Spurious mismatch warning for detached worktree switches**: Switching to a detached worktree by path produced a "Branch-worktree mismatch" warning because the directory name was treated as a branch name. ([#1686](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1686))

- **Detached worktree switch output showed redundant path**: Output now shows "detached worktree" instead of repeating the directory name (which duplicated the path after `@`). ([#1685](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1685))

- **Picker alt-r removal fixes**: Picker removals now validate the worktree synchronously before removing it from the list, perform the actual git removal on a background thread to prevent UI freezing, and correctly handle detached worktrees. ([#1699](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1699), [#1702](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1702), [#1717](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1717))

### Documentation

- Changelog and migration guide for hook rationalization. ([#1693](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1693))

### Internal

- All test git commands now go through `Cmd` for consistent debug logging and timing traces. ([#1714](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1714), [#1716](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1716), [#1718](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1718))

- Worktree removal logic extracted into shared helpers. ([#1683](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1683), [#1700](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1700), [#1701](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1701))

## 0.31.0

### Improved

- **Hook template variables consolidated**: Bare variables (`branch`, `worktree_path`, `commit`) now consistently point to the Active worktree — the destination for switch/create, the source for merge/remove. New directional variables (`{{ base }}`, `{{ base_worktree_path }}`, `{{ target_worktree_path }}`, `{{ cwd }}`) give hooks explicit access to both sides of two-worktree operations. (Breaking: `{{ worktree_path }}` changed in pre-switch for existing worktrees and in post-merge — use `{{ cwd }}` or `{{ base_worktree_path }}` for the previous behavior.) [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1655](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1655), [#1660](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1660), [#1663](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1663), thanks @sysradium for reporting [#1543](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1543))

- **Bare repo worktree-path prompt**: When a bare repo lives at a hidden path like `.git` or `.bare`, `wt switch` now detects that worktrees would get awkward names (e.g., `project/.git.feature`) and offers to configure a `worktree-path` override. Non-interactive environments show the config to add manually. ([#1656](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1656), thanks @seakayone for reporting [#1279](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1279))

- **Shell completion for step aliases**: Tab-completing `wt step <TAB>` now shows configured aliases alongside built-in step commands, with `--dry-run`, `--yes`, and `--var` flags. ([#1641](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1641))

- **`wt list` reclaims space from redundant columns**: When the Path column carries no useful information (all worktree paths are predictable from branch names), its space is reclaimed for Summary and Message. ([#1634](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1634))

- **Syntax highlighting for alias dry-run**: `wt step <alias> --dry-run` now uses bash syntax highlighting, matching hook dry-run output. ([#1635](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1635))

### Fixed

- **`wt list` hang from fsmonitor daemon**: On macOS with builtin fsmonitor, `wt list` could hang at the "(loading...)" stage because `git fsmonitor--daemon start` inherited pipe file descriptors and held them open indefinitely. ([#1648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1648))

- **Post-remove hooks ran at wrong directory**: Post-remove hooks executed at the user's cwd (which could be the worktree being removed) instead of the primary worktree. ([#1645](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1645))

- **Picker showed loading indicator for unavailable data**: The interactive picker used `⋯` (loading) for fields that would never arrive; now uses `·` (unavailable). ([#1651](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1651))

- **`wt hook --dry-run` missing directional variables**: Hook dry-run and `--show --expanded` output was missing `base`, `target`, and `target_worktree_path` variables for switch, create, and remove hooks. ([#1669](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1669))

### Documentation

- Bare repository layout guide and `worktree-path` example in config docs. ([#1664](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1664))

- Migration guide for template variable changes in hook docs. ([#1666](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1666))

### Internal

- Renamed internal `select` module to `picker`. ([#1650](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1650))

- Consolidated merge/remove removal validation. ([#1625](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1625))

## 0.30.1

### Fixed

- **Narrow terminal layout**: `wt switch` picker now uses vertical (Down) layout on terminals narrower than 80 columns, and the Branch column shrinks instead of being dropped — branch names are always visible. ([#1564](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1564), [#1626](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1626), thanks @armstrjare for reporting [#1563](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1563))

- **Bash tab completion showed all branches**: `wt switch feat<TAB>` displayed every branch instead of filtering by prefix, prompting "Display all N possibilities?" for users with many branches. Fish and zsh still use their native substring/fuzzy matching. ([#1622](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1622), thanks @altruic for reporting [#1621](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1621))

- **Hook command completion pre-filtered in all shells**: `HookCommandCompleter` filtered by prefix before returning candidates, preventing fish/zsh substring matching on hook command names. ([#1627](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1627))

- **`wt merge` failed with `submodule.recurse=true`**: Users with `submodule.recurse=true` in their git config saw push errors during merge. Local push now passes `--recurse-submodules=no`. ([#1619](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1619), thanks @viicslen for reporting [#1604](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1604))

- **Worktree sync uses safe `read-tree`**: Target worktree sync after `--no-ff` push uses `read-tree -m -u` instead of `reset --hard`, consistent with the project's norms. ([#1623](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1623))

### Internal

- Inlined `complete_branches` and `complete_hook_commands` into their respective completers. ([#1628](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1628), [#1627](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1627))

## 0.30.0

### Improved

- **`wt merge --no-ff`**: Create a merge commit instead of fast-forwarding, for semi-linear history (rebased commits plus a merge commit). Also available as `merge.no-ff = true` in user config. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/merge/) ([#1438](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1438), thanks @siriobalmelli)

- **`wt step eval`** [experimental]: Evaluate template expressions from the command line. All hook variables (`branch`, `repo`, `worktree_path`) and filters (`hash_port`, `sanitize`, `sanitize_db`) are available. Designed for scripting: `curl http://localhost:$(wt step eval '{{ branch | hash_port }}')/health`. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1004](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1004), thanks @EduardoSimon for the feature request in [#947](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/947))

- **`wt step push --no-ff`**: Mirrors `wt merge --no-ff` for manual step-by-step workflows: `wt step commit && wt step rebase && wt step push --no-ff`. ([#1587](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1587))

- **Worktree removal now hidden**: Removed worktrees are staged in `.git/wt/trash/` instead of a visible `.wt-removing-*` sibling directory. All worktrunk state consolidated under `.git/wt/`. ([#1583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1583), thanks @ortonomy for reporting [#1572](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1572))

### Fixed

- **`wt merge` could remove the default branch worktree in bare repos**: In bare repository layouts, merging from the default branch worktree could remove it instead of preserving it. ([#1620](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1620), thanks @viicslen for reporting [#1618](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1618))

- **`wt switch` panicked on empty picker selection**: Entering a non-existent branch name in the interactive picker caused a panic. Now returns an error message gracefully. ([#1566](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1566), thanks @dlnilsson for reporting [#1565](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1565))

- **`copy-ignored` lost directory permissions**: Source directory permissions (e.g., mode 0700 for Postgres data directories) were replaced with default 0755. ([#1590](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1590), thanks @RileyMathews for reporting [#1589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1589))

- **`copy-ignored` failed on broken symlinks at destination**: If a gitignored file's destination was already an invalid symlink, the copy failed with "No such file or directory". ([#1549](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1549), thanks @armstrjare for reporting [#1547](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1547))

- **Nushell `$env.PWD` errors after `wt remove`**: Removing a worktree from inside it produced repeated `$env.PWD points to a non-existent directory` errors in Nushell. ([#1508](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1508), thanks @mystilleef for reporting [#1507](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1507))

- **Remote URL used `insteadOf` rewrites**: `wt list` and PR detection used the rewritten remote URL instead of the raw config value, causing mismatches with CI and forge detection. ([#1546](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1546), thanks @volkanbicer)

- **SIGPIPE from pager quit treated as error**: Quitting a pager (e.g., `q` in `less`) during `wt step diff` showed "terminated by signal 13" instead of exiting cleanly. ([#1559](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1559))

- **Missing vs corrupt git config errors conflated**: Missing config keys and corrupt config files both returned the same error, making corrupt configurations hard to diagnose. ([#1610](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1610))

- **Shell operator precedence in remove command**: The `|| true` for fsmonitor stop had incorrect precedence, potentially swallowing failures from the entire removal chain. ([#1584](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1584))

- **Missing shell escaping in error hints**: Branch names and paths in suggested `cd ... && git switch ...` commands were not shell-escaped. ([#1584](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1584))

### Documentation

- **pnpm post-create example**: Added a recipe for running `pnpm install` after worktree creation via `copy-ignored`. ([#1581](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1581))

- **Hook execution order**: Clarified that post-create hooks run before post-start hooks. ([#1573](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1573))

## 0.29.4

### Improved

- **Destination branch in pre-switch hooks**: `{{ branch }}` in pre-switch hooks now expands to the **destination** branch (as typed by the user) instead of the source worktree's branch. Previously, pre-switch hooks could only see where you were, not where you were going. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1497](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1497), thanks @mayureshwaykole for the discussion in [#1494](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1494))

- **LLM tool commands in example config**: `wt config create` now includes double-commented entries for Claude, Codex, opencode, llm, and aichat commands, making them discoverable without reading the docs. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) ([#1531](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1531), [#1533](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1533))

### Fixed

- **Extra blank line in `config create` output**: The success path printed a blank line between the success message and hint lines, inconsistent with the "already exists" path. ([#1525](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1525))

### Documentation

- **Switch docs**: Trimmed upstream tracking paragraph, added missing `pre-switch`/`post-switch` hooks to creation lifecycle, combined GitHub/GitLab sections. ([#1521](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1521))

- **List docs**: Restored `--full` prerequisite note for LLM summaries. ([#1517](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1517))

- **Experimental badges in headings**: Moved experimental badges from description paragraphs to headings in web docs for cleaner TOC entries. ([#1523](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1523))

### Internal

- **CI improvements**: Prevented duplicate inline review comments across cycles, banned blocking `gh pr checks --watch`, fixed verify step for concurrency-cancelled runs, stopped hourly audit from flagging CI polling, added rolling file survey to nightly cleaner. ([#1514](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1514), [#1498](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1498), [#1519](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1519), [#1520](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1520), [#1522](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1522))

- **Simplified review-pr skill**: Cut metacognitive coaching and collapsed confidence tiers; 504 → 369 lines (−27%). ([#1530](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1530))

## 0.29.3

### Improved

- **Unified timeout model for list and picker**: Consolidated the picker's per-command timeout and list's experimental `timeout-ms` into a shared config with `[list] task-timeout-ms` (per-task, shared by both) and per-context wall-clock budgets (`[list] timeout-ms`, `[switch.picker] timeout-ms`). Picker default budget raised from 200ms per-command to 500ms wall-clock. ([#1515](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1515), [#1487](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1487))

- **Pre-flight template validation for `wt switch`**: Switch templates (`--execute` and hook commands) are now validated before worktree creation, preventing orphan worktrees from syntax errors like `{{ unclosed`. ([#1500](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1500))

### Fixed

- **`wt remove` allowed removing default branch worktree**: The default branch worktree (e.g., main) could be removed because it was trivially "integrated" into itself. Now blocked unless `-D` is used. ([#1460](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1460), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1448](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1448))

- **Symlinks copied as regular files in `copy-ignored`**: Top-level gitignored symlinks were copied as regular files instead of preserved as symlinks, breaking setups like Yarn monorepos. ([#1489](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1489), thanks @karmeleon for reporting [#1488](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1488))

- **Missing placeholders in WorkingDiff and Upstream columns**: These columns showed blank instead of `⋯`/`·` placeholders when data wasn't loaded, breaking the visual loading signal. ([#1503](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1503))

### Documentation

- **Step command docs**: Added promote subdoc, improved swap description, linked Operations index to subcommand sections, moved aliases section after subcommands, fixed cross-filesystem fallback description. ([#1505](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1505), [#1495](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1495), [#1502](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1502), [#1513](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1513))

- **List docs**: Documented placeholder symbols (`⋯`, `·`) in help text, rewrote LLM summaries section. ([#1496](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1496), [#1506](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1506))

- **Homepage**: Added headline features (CI status, PR checkout, hash_port) and tips link. ([#1501](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1501))

- **Experimental badge pills**: Styled `[experimental]` markers as pill badges in web docs. ([#1499](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1499))

### Internal

- **Deduplicated hook config resolution**: Extracted shared hook-type list and made `lookup_hook_configs` pub(crate). ([#1512](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1512))

- **Agent Skills metadata**: Added `metadata.internal: true` to repo-scoped skills so `npx skills add` only offers user-facing ones. ([#1491](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1491))

## 0.29.2

### Improved

- **`[switch] no-cd` config option**: Disable directory change by default with `no-cd = true` in the `[switch]` section. Use `--cd` flag to override when needed. Useful for tmux workflows where sessions handle navigation. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/config/) ([#1401](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1401), thanks @jradtilbrook)

### Fixed

- **GPG signature output breaks `wt list`**: When `log.showSignature` is set in git config, GPG verification lines contaminated stdout in `git log` calls, causing parse failures. All git log invocations now pass `--no-show-signature`. ([#1465](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1465), thanks @apre)

- **Tab completions ignore shell substring matching**: The binary was prefix-filtering branch candidates before returning them to the shell, preventing fish substring matching (`auth<TAB>` → `feature/user-auth`) and zsh fuzzy matching. Completions now return all candidates and let the shell apply its own matching. ([#1471](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1471), thanks @benjaminbauer for reporting [#1468](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1468))

- **Tab completions unusable in large repos**: Repos with many remote branches triggered the "do you wish to see all N possibilities?" prompt. Remote-only branches are now excluded when the total exceeds 100. ([#1442](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1442), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1415](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1415))

- **Nushell shell integration broken in Home Manager module**: The Nix Home Manager module used `use` instead of `source` for the nushell init script, and template definitions were not exported, preventing the `wt` wrapper function from loading. ([#1476](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1476), thanks @mystilleef for reporting [#1475](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1475))

### Documentation

- **Manual commit message recipes**: Added recipes to Tips & Patterns for using `commit.generation.command` config to write commit messages by hand with `$EDITOR` instead of an LLM. ([#1469](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1469), thanks @viicslen for the feature request in [#1467](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1467))

### Internal

- **Skill/CI guidance**: Improved Claude bot skills for triage, code review, and CI monitoring. ([#1485](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1485), [#1477](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1477), [#1474](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1474), [#1472](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1472), [#1470](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1470), [#1458](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1458), [#1447](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1447))

## 0.29.1

### Improved

- **GitHub Enterprise support for `wt switch`**: `wt switch pr:<number>` now works with GitHub Enterprise instances by extracting the hostname from the remote URL and passing `--hostname` to `gh`. ([#1408](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1408), thanks @TomRomeo)

- **`wt switch --no-cd` print mode**: When `wt switch --no-cd` opens the interactive picker (no branch argument), selecting a branch prints its name to stdout and exits — useful for scripting. ([#1445](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1445), thanks @ruudk for the feature request in [#1404](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1404))

- **Shadow warning for step aliases**: `wt step` now warns when a user-defined alias has the same name as a built-in step command (e.g., `commit`, `rebase`), since clap intercepts the built-in before the alias runs. ([#1389](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1389))

### Fixed

- **Post-switch hooks on `wt remove`**: When removing the current worktree, post-switch hooks now fire correctly as the user is implicitly switched to the primary worktree. Previously, project hooks were silently skipped because config lookup failed from the removed CWD. ([#1452](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1452), thanks @mjakl for reporting [#1450](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1450))

- **LLM commit session isolation**: The recommended Claude command for commit generation now includes `--no-session-persistence`, preventing commit conversations from polluting `claude --continue`. ([#1454](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1454))

- **Color formatting in error messages**: `DetachedHead` and `NotInWorktree` error messages now support color-print styling, matching other error variants. ([#1387](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1387))

- **Windows error handling**: Replaced `std::process::exit()` with proper error returns in Windows-specific code paths, so destructors and cleanup run correctly. ([#1456](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1456))

### Documentation

- **Hook JSON context section**: Fixed documentation that incorrectly described `hook_type` and `hook_name` as extras; added the TOML hook definition showing how JSON stdin is wired. ([#1360](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1360))

- **`wt remove` help text**: Updated example heading to clarify that `wt remove` works on both worktrees and branches. ([#1449](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1449))

- **Xcode DerivedData cleanup recipe**: Added recipe for cleaning Xcode build artifacts across worktrees. ([#1423](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1423), thanks @RickeyBoy)

### Internal

- **Refactoring**: Extracted handler functions from `main()` dispatch, replaced negated boolean variables with positive-polarity names (`no_verify` → `verify`, `no_delete_branch` → `keep_branch`). ([#1394](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1394), [#1388](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1388), [#1393](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1393))

- **Test reliability**: Resolved flaky PTY/timing issues in integration tests, consolidated trivial tests into inline snapshots. ([#1459](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1459), [#1392](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1392), [#1382](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1382), [#1390](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1390))

- **CI**: Added Zola docs validation to PR checks, catching broken internal anchor links before merge. ([#1396](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1396))

## 0.29.0

### Improved

- **`wt step <alias>` command**: User-defined command templates with template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, custom `--var KEY=VALUE`). Project-config aliases require approval; user-config aliases are trusted. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1348), thanks @cavanaug for the feature request in [#1214](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1214))

- **Remove worktrees from switch picker**: `alt-r` in `wt switch` interactive picker removes the highlighted worktree directly (no force flags — matches safety defaults). ([#1253](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1253), thanks @alfredomtx for the feature request in [#1251](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1251))

- **`wt hook <type> --dry-run`**: Preview hook expansion with template variables resolved, without executing. ([#1361](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1361))

- **Hook template variables**: `{{ hook_type }}` and `{{ hook_name }}` are now available in hook command templates. ([#1364](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1364))

- **Typo suggestions for step commands**: Unknown step commands and aliases now suggest the closest match. ([#1363](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1363))

- **Syntax-highlighted `--help`**: Code blocks in `--help` output now render with language-aware syntax highlighting (TOML, bash) instead of plain dimmed text. Help options are grouped under navigational headings (Picker Options, Automation). ([#1365](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1365), [#1355](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1355), [#1359](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1359))

- **Nix Home Manager module**: Install worktrunk via Nix Home Manager. ([#1287](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1287), thanks @DuskyElf; thanks @meicale for reporting [#1257](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1257))

- **Output styling**: Bold names replace quoted names in error messages, underlined references replace bright-black in hints, `@ path` convention unified in section headings, and branch-worktree mismatch warnings now show both actual and expected paths. ([#1375](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1375), [#1380](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1380), [#1285](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1285), [#1376](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1376), [#1377](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1377), thanks @jhigh2000 for reporting [#1184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1184))

### Fixed

- **`--no-cd` with interactive picker**: The `--no-cd` flag is now passed through when using `wt switch` with the interactive picker. ([#1331](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1331), thanks @cperalt for reporting [#1330](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1330))

- **Remote branches with `/` in picker**: `wt switch --remotes` now correctly handles remote branches with `/` in the name (e.g., `origin/user/feature`). ([#1266](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1266), thanks @curtbushko for reporting [#1260](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1260))

- **Nushell config path on Windows**: `wt config shell install` now uses the platform-appropriate config directory for nushell on Windows. ([#1294](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1294), thanks @deltoss for reporting [#1293](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1293))

- **Git for Windows per-user install**: Detect per-user Git for Windows installations and show a clean error message instead of panicking when Git Bash is not found. ([#1261](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1261), [#1262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1262), thanks @JefMasereel for reporting [#1259](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1259))

- **JSON output `summary` field**: `wt list --format=json` now includes the `summary` field. ([#1339](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1339))

- **Squash merge message**: Uses source branch name instead of target branch in the merge commit message. ([#1319](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1319), thanks @ricafeal)

- **Alias approval errors**: Propagate the real error (e.g., "no remote URL found") instead of a vague "Cannot determine project identifier". ([#1374](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1374))

- **`wt step prune` output**: Summary uses cleaner paired format ("Pruned 1 worktree & branch") and fixes post-remove hook display path for non-current worktrees. ([#1344](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1344))

- **VCS metadata in `copy-ignored`**: Exclude `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, `_darcs` directories from `wt step copy-ignored`. ([#1250](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1250))

- **Nix evaluation warning**: Use `stdenv.hostPlatform.system` instead of deprecated `system`. ([#1336](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1336), thanks @onelocked)

### Documentation

- **Home page SEO**: Canonical URL deduplication and consistent tagline. ([#1357](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1357))

- **LLM commit tools**: Add opencode and consolidate other LLM commit tool references. ([#1295](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1295))

### Internal

- **Git plumbing**: Replace porcelain commands with plumbing alternatives (`rev-parse --symbolic-full-name`, `log --no-walk`, `for-each-ref`) for more robust output parsing. Cache deprecated-variable regexes and fix silent wrong results in `same_commit()`/`trees_match()`. ([#1345](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1345), [#1338](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1338), [#1358](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1358))

- **Error propagation**: `repo_path()` and `ShellConfig::get()` now return `Result` instead of silently falling back. ([#1280](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1280), [#1262](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1262))

- **CI improvements**: Consolidated setup into composite action, replaced `gh run watch` with poll loops, added conflict resolution for bot PRs in nightly cleaner. ([#1273](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1273), [#1329](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1329), [#1307](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1307))

## 0.28.2

### Improved

- **`wt step prune` output**: Dirty or locked worktrees are silently skipped instead of printing warnings, and "No worktree found for branch" info messages are suppressed — prune output now shows only what was actually removed. ([#1236](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1236))

### Fixed

- **CWD removal hint**: After a worktree is removed while a shell is in that directory, the hint now checks whether `wt switch ^` would actually work before suggesting it — falls back to suggesting `wt list` when the default branch worktree doesn't exist (e.g., bare repos). ([#1238](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1238), thanks @davidbeesley for reporting [#1168](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1168))

- **Submodule detection in worktree removal**: Submodule detection now uses `git submodule status` output instead of parsing error messages, avoiding locale-dependent and version-dependent string matching. ([#1247](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1247))

### Internal

- **Hook dispatch**: Introduced `HookCommandSpec` struct and extracted helper functions to deduplicate hook dispatch code (~50 lines net reduction). ([#1248](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1248))

- **CI skills**: Fixed jq escaping in ad-hoc CI polling queries and improved Step 5 dismissal ordering in pr-review skill. ([#1241](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1241), [#1246](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1246))

## 0.28.1

### Improved

- **Nushell tab completions**: `wt switch <TAB>` and subcommand completions now work in nushell. ([#1220](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1220), thanks @omerxx for reporting [#1215](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1215))

- **`wt step prune` reliability**: Candidates are now removed inline as they're discovered instead of scan-then-remove, with per-candidate error handling (dirty worktrees are warned and skipped). Dry-run and execution summaries now distinguish worktrees, branches, and detached worktrees. Command marked `[experimental]`. ([#1234](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1234), [#1232](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1232), [#1223](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1223))

- **`wt step diff` performance**: Copies the real git index instead of creating an empty one, preserving git's stat cache so unchanged tracked files are skipped. ([#1230](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1230))

### Fixed

- **Branch delete race on fast-path remove**: `wt remove` now deletes merged branches synchronously on the fast path instead of deferring to the background process, fixing a race where `wt switch --create <branch>` fails with "branch already exists". ([#1216](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1216))

- **Panic in `is_bare()` on unusual repositories**: `is_bare()` now propagates errors instead of panicking. ([#1221](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1221), @bendrucker)

- **Help text table coloring**: Status symbols and backtick-enclosed text in `--help` tables now render with proper ANSI colors. ([#1231](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1231))

### Internal

- **CI workflow**: Added concurrency group to claude-mention workflow, fixed external contributor PR review permissions. ([#1233](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1233), [#1226](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1226))

## 0.28.0

### Improved

- **`wt step prune` command**: Remove worktrees whose branches are already merged into the default branch. Skips unmerged and recently created worktrees, with `--min-age` to control the staleness threshold. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#1191](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1191))

- **Color palette in `wt config shell show-theme`**: Shows each color and style rendered in itself — base colors, modifiers, bold+color and dim+color variants — for diagnosing legibility issues on different terminal themes. ([#1185](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1185), thanks @jhigh2000 for reporting [#1184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1184))

- **Smarter column layout in `wt list`**: The Message column is hidden when the terminal is too narrow for Summary to reach 40 characters, preventing both columns from being truncated to unreadable widths. ([#1166](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1166))

### Fixed

- **Submodules in worktree removal**: `wt remove` now handles worktrees containing initialized git submodules, which previously failed with "working trees containing submodules cannot be moved or removed". ([#1196](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1196), thanks @dlecan for reporting [#1194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1194))

- **CWD recovery validation**: Recovery from a deleted worktree directory now validates that candidate repositories actually contain the deleted path as a worktree, preventing false matches when multiple repos share a parent directory. ([#1193](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1193))

- **Shell-escape paths in `-C` flag hints**: Paths containing spaces or special characters in `-C` hints are now properly shell-escaped. ([#1173](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1173))

- **ANSI handling in CWD recovery**: Recovery messages now use `anstream` for proper ANSI handling on terminals that don't support color. ([#1183](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1183))

- **Worktree path in detached HEAD removal messages**: Removal output for detached HEAD worktrees now includes the worktree path for clarity. ([#1210](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1210))

- **Pruned worktree output**: Worktree and branch deletion for pruned worktrees are combined into a single output line instead of two separate messages. ([#1211](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1211))

### Documentation

- **Page metadata and SEO**: All doc pages now have `<meta name="description">`, canonical URLs, and structured data (JSON-LD) for better search engine visibility. ([#1167](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1167))

### Internal

- **CI bot improvements**: Inline suggestions, confidence-based review scrutiny, consolidated review+CI analysis, self-poll prevention, verified-facts guideline for triage, and explicit issue-closing in nightly cleaner. ([#1172](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1172), [#1181](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1181), [#1199](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1199), [#1204](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1204), [#1212](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1212), [#1198](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1198), [#1209](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1209))

## 0.27.0

### Improved

- **`wt step promote` command (experimental)**: Exchange branches between the main worktree and any linked worktree, including swapping gitignored files (build artifacts, `.env`, `node_modules/`). Shows mismatch state in `wt list` with ⚑ indicator; restore with no arguments from main worktree. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#789](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/789), thanks @zpeleg for the feature request in [#738](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/738))

- **Instant worktree removal**: `wt remove` now renames the worktree to a staging path before spawning the background cleanup, making the path unavailable immediately instead of after a 1-second sleep. Falls back to legacy removal if rename fails (cross-filesystem, permissions). ([#773](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/773))

- **Graceful recovery from deleted worktree directory**: When a worktree is removed while a shell is still in that directory, `wt switch` and `wt list` now recover automatically — find the parent repository from `$PWD` and proceed without pre-switch hooks. ([#1146](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1146), thanks @davidbeesley for reporting [#1109](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1109))

- **PR/MR support promoted out of experimental**: GitHub PR (`pr:<number>`) and GitLab MR (`mr:<number>`) targets in `wt switch` are now considered stable — 11 minor releases with no interface changes since v0.15.0. ([#1114](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1114))

### Fixed

- **SSH URLs with ports**: Remote matching now handles `ssh://git@host:2222/owner/repo.git` — ports are stripped during URL parsing instead of rejecting the URL. ([#1151](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1151))

- **Config path resolution**: `wt config create` now resolves the same path as config loading, fixing a mismatch when using XDG directories. ([#1135](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1135), thanks @christopher-buss for reporting [#1134](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1134))

- **PTY prompt echo interleaving**: Approval prompts no longer intermix with echoed input on slower systems. Uses quiescence detection instead of a fixed sleep. ([#1133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1133))

- **Better diagnostics when foreground removal fails**: When `wt remove --foreground` fails with "Directory not empty", now shows the remaining top-level entries (capped at 10) and suggests trying background removal. ([#1150](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1150))

- **Output formatting consistency**: Hints use canonical "To X, run Y" phrasing, config update hints render in gutter blocks with correct `-C` flag for linked worktrees, and ANSI color nesting fixed in hint messages. ([#1138](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1138), [#1137](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1137))

- **Panic-safe error propagation**: Replaced `.unwrap()` and `.expect()` calls in functions returning `Result` with proper `?` and `bail!` error propagation. ([#1127](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1127))

### Documentation

- **Bot trigger renamed**: CI bot responds to `@worktrunk-bot` instead of `@claude`, matching the actual GitHub username. ([#1149](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1149))

- **`wt step promote` documented in worktree model**: The branch-exchange operation is noted as the sole exception to the "never retarget a worktree" rule. ([#1154](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1154))

### Internal

- **CI security model**: Rulesets, token consolidation, and environment protection hardened for GitHub Actions workflows. ([#1118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1118))

- **Nightly CI workflows**: Automated review of Claude CI session logs and 24-hour code quality sweep for bugs, missing tests, and stale docs. ([#1111](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1111))

- **CI reviewer and bot improvements**: Better failure tracing, Dependabot PR reviews, thread resolution ordering, LGTM dedup, actionable feedback, automatic response to bot PR comments, and graceful handling of mentions on merged/closed PRs. ([#1117](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1117), [#1128](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1128), [#1129](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1129), [#1131](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1131), [#1141](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1141), [#1142](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1142), [#1145](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1145), [#1147](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1147), [#1153](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1153), [#1158](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1158), [#1164](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1164))

## 0.26.1

### Fixed

- **Statusline panic without LLM config**: `wt list statusline` panicked when no LLM command was configured. Now skips summary generation gracefully. ([#1107](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1107))

### Internal

- Demo GIFs now show the Summary column in `wt list --full` output. ([#1104](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1104), [#1106](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1106))
- CI session log uploads fixed to use correct path. ([#1103](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1103))

## 0.26.0

### Improved

- **Summary column in `wt list --full`**: LLM-generated one-line branch descriptions. Opt-in via `[list] summary = true` in config (experimental). Requires `[commit.generation]` config. ([#1100](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1100))

- **`wt step diff` command**: Show all uncommitted and untracked changes that `wt merge` would include as a unified diff against the merge base. Pass `-- --stat` for a summary. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) Closes [#1043](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1043). ([#1074](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1074), thanks @davidbeesley for the feature discussion)

- **`pre-switch` hook**: New hook that runs before `wt switch` validation. Use it to fetch-if-stale or run pre-flight checks before switching. Respects `--no-verify`. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/hook/) ([#1094](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1094), thanks @jdb8 for the use case in [#1085](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1085))

- **`wt config update` command**: Automatically apply config migrations — detects deprecated patterns (template variables, `[commit-generation]`, `approved-commands`), shows a diff preview, and applies with confirmation. Use `--yes` to skip the prompt. ([#1083](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1083))

- **Configurable picker timeout**: New `[switch.picker] timeout-ms` setting (default: 200ms, `0` to disable). The `[select]` config section is deprecated in favor of `[switch.picker]` — run `wt config update` to migrate. ([#1087](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1087))

- **Command audit log**: All hook executions and LLM commands are logged to `.git/wt-logs/commands.jsonl` with timestamps, exit codes, and duration. Auto-rotates at 1MB. View with `wt config state logs get` or query with `jq`. ([#1088](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1088))

### Fixed

- **Hook CWD wrong from subdirectories**: Hooks invoked from a subdirectory within a worktree ran with incorrect CWD and `{{ worktree_path }}`/`{{ worktree_name }}` template variables resolved incorrectly. ([#1097](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1097))

- **`copy-ignored` verbose output and error handling**: `-v` flag was silently ignored, error messages lacked file paths, and broken symlinks from interrupted copies caused failures. Also skips non-regular files (sockets, FIFOs) instead of failing. Fixes [#1084](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1084). ([#1090](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1090), thanks @jdb8 for reporting)

- **Nushell `wt list` piping**: `wt list --format json | from json` failed in nushell because the wrapper's stdout capture prevented piping. Fixes [#1062](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1062). ([#1081](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1081), thanks @omerxx for reporting)

- **Approved-commands lost during config migration**: Running the config migration could silently discard existing approval data. Now copies `approved-commands` entries to `approvals.toml` before migration. ([#1079](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1079))

- **Deprecation messages reference `wt config update`**: Deprecation warnings now point to the new `wt config update` command for one-step migration instead of manual `mv` instructions. ([#1089](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1089))

### Documentation

- **`wt switch` help text**: Updated description to "Switch to a worktree; create if needed" to surface auto-create behavior. ([#1082](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1082))

- **Docs syntax highlighting**: Migrated to giallo engine with a warm theme. ([#1080](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1080))

### Internal

- **CI reviewer improvements**: File-based GraphQL queries, centralized shell quoting guidance, artifact upload path fixes. ([#1091](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1091), [#1098](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1098), [#1099](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1099))

- **Issue triage for external contributors**: CI triage workflow now runs for all external contributor issues. ([#1086](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1086))

## 0.25.0

### Improved

- **System-wide config file**: Load organization-wide defaults from a system config file (`/etc/xdg/worktrunk/config.toml` on Linux, `/Library/Application Support/worktrunk/config.toml` on macOS) before user config. Override the path with `$WORKTRUNK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH`. Visible in `wt config show`. ([#963](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/963), thanks @goodtune)

- **AI summary preview in `wt switch`**: New 5th tab shows AI-generated branch summaries using your configured `[commit.generation]` LLM command. Opt-in via `[list] summary = true` in config. Summaries are cached in `.git/wt-cache/summaries/` with hash-based invalidation. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/) ([#1049](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1049))

- **Approvals stored in dedicated file**: Approved commands moved from `config.toml` to `approvals.toml`, enabling dotfile management of config without exposing machine-local trust state. Existing approvals in `config.toml` are read automatically with a deprecation warning and migration instructions in `wt config show`. ([#1042](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1042))

- **Error hints include `--execute` context**: When `wt switch --execute=<cmd>` fails, suggested commands now include the full `--execute` and trailing args so you can copy-paste the fix directly. ([#1064](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1064))

- **`wt list` startup performance**: Config resolution moved into the parallel phase, running concurrently with other git commands instead of sequentially on the critical path. ([#1054](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1054))

### Fixed

- **Submodule worktree path resolution**: `wt switch` resolved to `.git/modules/` instead of the working directory inside git submodules. Fixes [#1069](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1069). ([#1070](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1070), thanks @SokiKawashima for reporting)

- **Per-project `[list] timeout` ignored**: The timeout setting from per-project config (`[projects."name".list]`) was not applied — only the global config value was used. ([#1063](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1063))

- **Empty repos crash `wt list`**: Repositories with no commits (unborn HEAD) caused errors. Now renders empty cells for commit-dependent fields. ([#1058](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1058))

- **Stray blank lines before hints in error output**: Error messages with hints (↳) had an extra blank line separating the hint from its subject. ([#1072](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1072))

### Internal

- **Shell escaping consolidation**: Dropped `shlex` crate, consolidated on `shell_escape` across the codebase. ([#1065](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1065))

- **CI reviewer improvements**: Resolve review threads, skip trivial re-approvals, default to suggestions. ([#1068](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1068))

## 0.24.1

### Improved

- **Template error messages**: Template expansion errors now show what failed, the failing template line, and available variables for undefined variable errors. ([#1041](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1041))

- **Interactive picker preview speed**: Preview pre-computation is parallelized via rayon, reducing the chance of a blocking cache miss when switching preview tabs. ([#1048](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1048))

- **`wt switch` performance**: Switching to existing worktrees defers path computation, reducing startup latency. ([#1029](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1029), [#1030](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1030), [#1031](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1031))

### Fixed

- **PowerShell wrapper swallows `-D` flag**: The wrapper's `[Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]` promoted it to an "advanced function", causing PowerShell to consume `-D` as `-Debug` instead of passing it to `wt.exe`. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). ([#1057](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1057), thanks @DiTo97 for reporting)

- **Nushell shell integration**: Multiple fixes for nushell — auto-detect for install even without vendor/autoload directory ([#1032](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1032)), detection checks multiple config paths ([#1038](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1038)), uninstall cleans all candidate locations ([#1050](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1050)), wrapper hardening and improved diagnostics ([#1059](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1059)). (thanks @arnaudlimbourg for [#1032](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1032), [#1038](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1038), and @omerxx for reporting in [#964](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/964))

- **Interactive picker leaves screen artifacts**: The picker left visual artifacts after exiting. Fixes [#1027](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1027). ([#1028](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1028), [#1044](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1044), thanks @davidbeesley)

- **Statusline counts files outside sparse checkout cone**: Branch diff statistics in the statusline included files outside the sparse checkout cone, inflating counts. ([#1024](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1024), thanks @bendrucker)

- **Template placeholders leak into displayed commands**: `{{ }}` delimiters in hook commands were incorrectly syntax-highlighted, showing ANSI artifacts instead of the template text. ([#1022](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1022))

- **Hook announcement trailing colon**: Hook announcements like "Running post-merge project:sync:" had a trailing colon that created visual noise. ([#1025](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1025))

- **Blank line after approval prompts**: Approval prompts showed an extra blank line after the user pressed Enter. ([#1040](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1040))

### Internal

- **Automated Claude PR review**: Added workflow for automated code review on PRs. ([#1037](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1037))

- **Time-to-first-output benchmarks**: Added benchmarks for `remove`, `switch`, and `list` startup latency. ([#1023](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1023))

## 0.24.0

### Improved

- **Nushell support (experimental)**: Initial nushell shell integration — shell wrapper, completions, and `wt config shell install` support. This is a proof-of-concept and will need iteration before it's usable; if you're a nushell user feel free to try it and report issues. ([#964](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/964), thanks @arnaudlimbourg)

- **Version check in `wt config show --full`**: The diagnostics section now queries GitHub for the latest release and shows "Up to date", "Update available", or "Version check unavailable". Gated behind `--full` so normal commands are unaffected. Closes [#1003](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1003). ([#1011](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1011), thanks @risperdal for requesting)

- **Fish outdated wrapper detection**: `wt config show` now detects when the installed fish shell wrapper has outdated code (e.g., from a previous version) and shows "Outdated shell extension" with a reinstall hint, instead of incorrectly reporting "Not configured". ([#1009](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1009))

### Fixed

- **LLM subprocess blocked in Claude Code sessions**: Claude Code sets `CLAUDECODE=1` which blocks nested invocations, breaking `wt step commit` and `wt merge` commit generation. Now strips the env var before spawning the LLM command. ([#1021](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1021))

- **Blank line between hint and subject in config show**: The "To configure, run wt config shell install" hint was visually detached from the shell entries it referred to. ([#1007](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1007))

### Documentation

- **Status symbol descriptions**: Corrected quick start documentation — `↕` means diverged from default branch (not unpushed commits), `+` means staged changes (not uncommitted changes). ([#1017](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1017))

- **Claude Code commit command**: Added `CLAUDECODE` env var unsetting to the Claude Code documentation for commit message generation. ([#1020](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1020))

### Internal

- **Environment variable prefix standardization**: Renamed remaining `WT_TEST_*` env vars to `WORKTRUNK_TEST_*`, completing the prefix migration. ([#1016](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1016))

- **Plugin metadata**: Aligned plugin description with Cargo.toml tagline ([#1019](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1019)), fixed duplicate skills declaration ([#1014](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1014), thanks @jacksonblankenship for reporting [#1013](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/1013)), corrected marketplace source path ([#1012](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1012)).

## 0.23.3

### Improved

- **Error display for failed commands**: Failed git commands are now shown in a separate bash-highlighted gutter block instead of inline parenthesized text, making long commands much more readable. ([#1001](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1001))

- **PowerShell detection and diagnostics**: Detect PowerShell via `PSModulePath` environment variable so Windows users get "shell requires restart" instead of "not installed". `wt config show` now displays the detected shell and verification hints. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). ([#987](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/987), thanks @DiTo97 for reporting)

### Fixed

- **Fish shell wrapper incompatible with fish < 3.1**: The shell wrapper used `VAR=value command` syntax which requires fish 3.1+. Now uses `env VAR=value ...` for compatibility with all fish versions. Fixes [#999](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/999). ([#1000](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/1000), thanks @chrisrickard for reporting)

- **Symlink paths resolved in display messages**: Status messages like "Created worktree @ path" showed canonical paths instead of the user's symlink path. Now consistent with cd directives. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/968). ([#985](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/985), thanks @brooke-hamilton for reporting)

### Documentation

- **Deduplicated manual shell setup**: Removed duplicated per-shell eval snippets from `wt config --help`, referencing `wt config shell init --help` instead. ([#986](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/986))

- **PowerShell diagnostic guidance**: Added PowerShell-specific debugging steps to shell integration and troubleshooting references. ([#993](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/993))

## 0.23.2

### Improved

- **`--force` flag for `wt step copy-ignored`**: Overwrite existing destination files when copying gitignored files to new worktrees. Closes [#971](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/971). ([#974](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/974), thanks @williamgoulois for requesting)

### Fixed

- **`wt switch pr:NNNN` / `mr:NNNN` fails in repos without fetch refspecs**: Same-repo PRs and MRs failed with "No branch named X" in single-branch clones or bare repos because fetch didn't create remote tracking branches, and worktree creation relied on DWIM. Now uses explicit refspecs and `-b` fallback. ([#965](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/965), thanks @andoniaf)

- **Progressive table garbled when output exceeds terminal height**: `wt list` output was corrupted when more lines than the terminal height, because cursor-up commands tried to reach scrolled-off lines. Now detects overflow and falls back to a clean full-table print. ([#981](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/981))

- **Symlink paths resolved to canonical in cd directives**: When navigating via symlinks, cd directives wrote canonical paths, silently moving users out of their symlink tree. Now preserves the user's logical path. Fixes [#968](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/968). ([#976](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/976), thanks @brooke-hamilton for reporting)

- **Terminal artifacts when cancelling interactive picker**: Pressing Esc to cancel the picker left terminal artifacts and a misplaced cursor. Now skim handles cleanup symmetrically for both cancel and accept. ([#984](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/984))

### Documentation

- **Hook examples: safer port cleanup**: Added `-sTCP:LISTEN` to `lsof` in hook examples to prevent accidentally killing unrelated processes with connections to the port. ([#952](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/952), thanks @andoniaf)

## 0.23.1

### Improved

- **Interactive picker runs hooks**: `wt switch` without arguments (the interactive picker) now runs post-switch, post-start, and post-create hooks, matching the non-interactive path. ([#942](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/942))

- **Combined hook output during removal**: Post-remove and post-switch hooks during worktree removal are now shown on a single output line instead of two separate lines. ([#943](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/943))

### Fixed

- **Shell escape corruption with template filters**: Shell escaping was applied before template rendering, so filters like `sanitize` operated on already-escaped strings, corrupting values with special characters (e.g., apostrophes in branch names). ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

- **`wt switch -` history corruption**: `wt switch foo` while already in `foo` would incorrectly record `foo` as the previous branch, breaking `wt switch -` ping-pong. ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

- **`--base` without `--create` showed wrong error**: Using `--base` without `--create` could produce misleading errors (e.g., "No previous branch") instead of the expected warning that `--base` requires `--create`. ([#944](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/944))

## 0.23.0

### Improved

- **Preserve subdirectory position when switching**: `wt switch` now lands in the same subdirectory of the target worktree if it exists, falling back to the root if it doesn't. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/) ([#939](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/939), thanks @frederik-suerig for requesting)

- **`wt switch --no-cd`**: Skip the directory change after switching, useful for scripting or running commands in another worktree without leaving your current shell position. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/switch/) ([#932](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/932), thanks @ArnaudRinquin for requesting)

- **`Alt-c` to create worktree from picker**: In the interactive picker, press `Alt-c` to create a new worktree using the current query as the branch name. ([#933](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/933))

- **Faster preview tab switching**: Preview tabs (HEAD±, log, main…±, remote⇅) are now pre-computed in a background thread, making tab switching near-instant. ([#935](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/935))

### Fixed

- **Pager width detection**: Makes preview pane width available to pagers via `$COLUMNS`, so tools like delta can use it for correct side-by-side rendering (e.g., `pager = "delta --width=$COLUMNS"`). Fixes [#924](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/924). (thanks @tnlanh for reporting) ([#930](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/930))

- **ANSI style bleeding in preview tabs**: Fixed styling artifacts where dividers appeared emphasized and diffstat lines appeared dim. ([#931](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/931))

- **URL template expansion with `--skip`**: Skip URL template expansion when `--skip url-status` is used, avoiding unnecessary work. ([#923](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/923))

- **Hook error consistency**: `wt hook <type>` now errors consistently for all hook types when no hooks are configured, instead of silently succeeding for some types. ([#916](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/916))

### Documentation

- Improved install instructions in release notes. ([#918](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/918))

### Internal

- CI: check for existing fix PRs before creating duplicates. ([#922](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/922))

## 0.22.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch` integrates interactive picker**: `wt switch` without arguments now opens the interactive picker (previously `wt select`). The separate `wt select` command is deprecated with a warning directing users to use `wt switch` instead. Closes [#890](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/890). (thanks @strangemonad for the suggestion) ([#894](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/894))

- **TOML syntax highlighting**: Config output from `wt config show` and `wt config shell show-theme` now renders TOML with syntax highlighting (table headers cyan, string values green, comments dimmed). ([#905](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/905))

- **Bash syntax highlighting improvements**: Multi-line bash commands in hook previews now preserve syntax highlighting across newlines. Wrapped continuation lines are indented with 3 extra spaces to distinguish terminal-forced wraps from actual newlines. ([#906](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/906))

- **Unified background hook output**: Contiguous post-switch and post-start hooks are now combined into a single output line instead of two separate lines. ([#908](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/908))

### Documentation

- Removed redundant horizontal rules before H1 headers in documentation pages. ([#909](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/909))

### Internal

- Updated GitHub Actions and Rust nightly versions. ([#910](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/910))
- Bumped tree-sitter ecosystem to 0.26 for unified multi-line highlighting. ([#906](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/906))
- Dependency updates: minijinja 2.15.1, clap, indexmap, ignore, thiserror, time, and others. ([#912](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/912), [#913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/913))

## 0.21.0

### Improved

- **Absolute paths in `worktree-path` templates**: New `{{ repo_path }}` variable enables absolute path configurations like `{{ repo_path }}/../{{ repo }}.{{ branch | sanitize }}`. Tilde expansion is also supported (`~/worktrees/{{ repo }}/{{ branch }}`). Fixes [#902](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/902). (thanks @bingryan for reporting) ([#904](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/904))

### Documentation

- Documented prefix stripping in `worktree-path` templates using minijinja's built-in `replace` filter and slicing syntax. Closes [#900](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/900). (thanks @laurentkempe for requesting) ([#903](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/903))

## 0.20.3

### Fixed

- **PowerShell auto-configuration on Windows**: When running `wt config shell install` from cmd.exe or PowerShell, both PowerShell profile files are now created automatically (Documents/PowerShell and Documents/WindowsPowerShell). Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). (thanks @DiTo97 for reporting) ([#898](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/898))

- **`-C` flag respected in hook context**: The `-C` flag now correctly sets the worktree path for hooks, fixing `wt -C /path hook ...` commands that were using the wrong context. ([#899](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/899))

- **`--config` path validation**: Now warns when `--config` points to a non-existent file instead of silently using defaults. ([#895](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/895))

### Documentation

- Fix shell quoting in hook examples — template variables are auto-escaped, so manual quoting caused issues with special characters. ([#895](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/895))

- Updated documentation to use tool-agnostic terminology for LLM commit messages. ([#891](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/891))

### Internal

- Consolidated PR/MR resolution into unified `remote_ref` module. ([#893](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/893))

- Simplified command structure and removed dead code. ([#892](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/892))

- Eliminated Settings types, added accessor methods to Config types. ([#896](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/896))

## 0.20.2

### Fixed

- **PowerShell shell integration**: Fixed shell integration not working on Windows PowerShell. The init script now includes `| Out-String` to convert array output to a string. Existing configs without this fix are detected as "not installed" so `wt config shell install` will update them automatically. Fixes [#885](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/885). (thanks @DiTo97 for reporting) ([#888](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/888))

- **Branch removal message**: "No worktree found for branch X" now shows as info (○) instead of warning (▲) when removing a branch-only, since this is expected behavior. ([#887](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/887))

### Documentation

- Documented main worktree behavior in `wt step relocate --help`. ([#889](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/889))

## 0.20.1

### Improved

- **`wt statusline --format=json`**: Output current worktree as JSON (same structure as `wt list --format=json`). Also adds `--format=claude-code` as canonical syntax (the old `--claude-code` flag remains supported). Fixes nested worktree detection that incorrectly identified parent worktrees. ([#875](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/875))

- **`wt config show` shell status**: Each shell integration line now starts with the shell name (e.g., "bash: Already configured...") for easier scanning. ([#881](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/881))

- **`wt config show` performance**: 8x faster (~1.2s → ~150ms) by using PATH lookup instead of running `claude --version`. ([#883](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/883))

### Fixed

- **Config TOML formatting**: Fixed spurious empty `[commit]` header appearing when only `[commit.generation]` is configured. ([#879](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/879))

- **Documentation URLs**: Fixed broken worktrunk.dev URLs in fish wrapper and config templates. ([#882](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/882))

### Documentation

- Fixed `worktree-path` example on tips page. ([#876](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/876), thanks @uriahcarpenter)

- Fixed OSC 8 hyperlink sequences leaking through to web docs as garbage text. ([#870](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/870))

### Internal

- Demo snapshot mode for regression testing of command output. ([#871](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/871))

- CI improvements: nextest binary compatibility fix, pinned runner versions, weekly renovation workflow. ([#878](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/878), [#884](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/884))

## 0.20.0

### Improved

- **`wt step relocate` command**: Move worktrees to their expected paths based on the `worktree-path` template. Supports `--dry-run` preview, filtering by branch name, and `--commit` to auto-commit dirty worktrees before moving. Handles complex scenarios including worktree swaps (A→B, B→A), chains, and the `--clobber` flag to back up blocking non-worktree paths. [Docs](https://worktrunk.dev/step/) ([#790](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/790))

- **LLM setup prompt**: First-time interactive prompt when users attempt `wt merge`, `wt step commit`, or `wt step squash` without LLM configuration. Detects available tools (claude, codex) and offers auto-configuration with `?` to preview the generated config. Add `skip-commit-generation-prompt` to user config to suppress. ([#867](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/867))

- **Consistent prompt styling**: Interactive prompts now use consistent cyan styling via `prompt_message()` formatting. ([#858](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/858))

### Fixed

- **Path display in error messages**: User-facing paths now consistently use `format_path_for_display()`, fixing cases where raw `.display()` output could show inconsistent path formats. ([#856](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/856))

### Documentation

- Added Quick Start section to front page showing the switch → list → merge workflow. ([#864](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/864))
- Updated template documentation: removed deprecated `template-file` options, added `{{ git_diff_stat }}` variable, clarified squash-only variables. ([#854](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/854))
- Fixed stale documentation for `[commit.generation]` config format, statusline context gauge, and CI status for remote-only branches. ([#853](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/853))

### Internal

- Bumped nix crate from 0.30.1 to 0.31.1. ([#860](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/860))
- Refactored deprecation detection for better modularity. ([#852](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/852))

## 0.19.0

### Improved

- **LLM commit configuration redesign**: The `[commit-generation]` section is now `[commit.generation]`, and `command` + `args` are unified into a single shell-executed `command` string. Existing configs continue to work — a deprecation warning shows the new format and creates a `.new` config file you can apply with `mv`. Claude Code (`claude -p`) and Codex (`codex exec`) are documented as first-class options alongside `llm`. See the [LLM commits guide](https://worktrunk.dev/llm-commits/). ([#809](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/809), [#837](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/837))

- **Per-project hooks**: User config can define hooks per-project that append to global hooks. Execution order: global → per-project → project config. Configure under `[projects."owner/repo".hooks]`. ([#842](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/842))

- **Context window gauge for Claude Code**: Statusline mode shows a moon phase gauge (🌕🌔🌓🌒🌑) for context window usage. ([#840](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/840))

- **CI status for remote-only branches**: `wt list --remotes` shows CI status for branches that only exist on the remote. ([#817](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/817))

- **Hook log file lookup**: `wt config state logs get --hook=<spec>` returns the path to a specific hook's log file. ([#816](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/816), thanks @EduardoSimon for requesting)

- **Branch/fork info in PR/MR display**: `wt switch pr:N` shows the source branch (e.g., `feature-auth`) or fork reference (e.g., `contributor:feature`) alongside PR details. ([#808](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/808))

- **Claude Code section in `wt config show`**: Shows Claude CLI installation status, plugin status, and statusline configuration. ([#833](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/833))

- **Deprecation details moved to `wt config show`**: Other commands show a brief pointer instead of full deprecation details. ([#828](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/828))

- **Config validation suggests correct file**: When a config key belongs in user config but appears in project config (or vice versa), the warning suggests the correct location. ([#804](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/804))

- **Tilde paths in hints**: Shell command hints use `~` instead of full home directory paths when safe. ([#710](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/710))

- **Improved `--create` conflict error**: `wt switch --create pr:101` shows the existing branch name in the error. ([#807](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/807))

- **CI status prioritized in statusline**: CI status is retained longer when the statusline truncates. ([#845](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/845))

### Fixed

- **Template expansion bugs**: Fixed `worktree_path_of_branch` not respecting shell_escape flag, Windows CI cache rename failures, and `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS=0` meaning "no limit". ([#847](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/847), [#849](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/849))

- **Hook and CI status panics**: Fixed panic when serializing mixed named/unnamed hook configs, banned colons in hook names to prevent parsing ambiguity, and fixed GitLab MR detection when multiple MRs exist without project ID. ([#846](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/846), [#848](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/848))

- **Pre-commit hooks for clean worktree squash**: Pre-commit hooks are collected for approval when squashing on a clean worktree. Previously only collected when dirty. ([#695](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/695))

- **Hint message formatting**: Fixed ANSI escape code interference in dim hint messages. ([#836](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/836))

- **Spurious [commit] header**: Fixed config migration showing `[commit]` section header when only `commit-generation` fields needed migration. ([#834](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/834))

### Documentation

- Added at-a-glance examples to config documentation. ([#826](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/826))
- Clarified user project-specific settings section. ([#835](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/835))
- Consistent worktree terminology throughout docs. ([#813](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/813))
- Added tip for monitoring hook logs. ([#838](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/838))

### Internal

- Replaced manual quote escaping with `shell_escape` crate. ([#810](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/810))
- Used `sanitize-filename` crate for filename sanitization. ([#832](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/832))
- Cached CI tool availability checks. ([#831](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/831))
- Moved inline imports to module top level. ([#818](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/818), [#819](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/819), [#820](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/820), [#822](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/822))

## 0.18.2

### Improved

- **PR/MR context display**: `wt switch pr:N` and `mr:N` now show PR/MR details (title, author, state, URL) after fetching. ([#782](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/782))

- **Fork PR branch conflicts**: When a fork PR's branch name conflicts with an existing local branch (e.g., contributor opens PR from their `main`), worktrunk now creates a prefixed branch like `contributor/main` instead of failing. Closes [#714](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/714). (thanks @vimtor for reporting)

### Fixed

- **Help output formatting**: Fixed double blank lines appearing after demo comments in help output. ([#795](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/795))

- **Error handling reliability**: Replaced fragile string-based error parsing with structured approaches for git stash, GitHub CLI, and GitLab CLI operations. ([#787](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/787))

### Documentation

- **ci-status help text**: Improved clarity of the ci-status configuration documentation. ([#794](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/794))

- **wt remove help text**: Simplified short description and added documentation for `pre-remove` and `post-remove` hooks. ([#792](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/792))

- **Subcommand documentation**: Fixed generated website docs for subcommands (like `wt step copy-ignored`, `wt config state`) to include their short descriptions. ([#793](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/793))

## 0.18.1

### Fixed

- **Submodule worktree paths**: Worktrees are now created in the correct location when running inside a git submodule. Previously, worktrees were created relative to the parent repo's `.git/modules/` directory instead of the submodule's working directory. ([#762](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/762), thanks @lajarre; [#777](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/777), thanks @mhonsel for reporting)
- **Shell integration warnings**: Warnings about shell integration now check if the *current* shell has integration configured, not whether *any* shell does. This fixes misleading "shell requires restart" messages when e.g. bash had integration but the user was running fish. ([#772](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/772))
- **"Not found" error messages**: Improved error message phrasing — "No branch named X" instead of "Branch X not found", "Branch X has no worktree" instead of "No worktree found for branch X". Context-appropriate hints now appear (e.g., `wt remove` no longer suggests `--create`). ([#774](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/774))

### Internal

- Unified PR/MR reference resolution, reducing code duplication. ([#778](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/778))

## 0.18.0

### Improved

- **Post-remove hook**: New hook type runs after worktree removal. Template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree_path }}`, `{{ commit }}`) reference the removed worktree, enabling cleanup scripts for containers, servers, or other resources. ([#757](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/757))
- **Graceful handling of missing worktree directories**: `wt remove` now prunes stale git metadata when the worktree directory was deleted externally (e.g., `rm -rf`), making the command more idempotent. Fixes [#724](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/724). (thanks @strangemonad for reporting)
- **Config validation warnings at load time**: Unknown fields in config files (typos like `[commit-gen]` instead of `[commit-generation]`) now show warnings immediately instead of only in `wt config show`. ([#758](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/758))

### Fixed

- **Age column shows "future" on NixOS/direnv**: `wt list` no longer uses `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` for time calculations, which NixOS and direnv commonly set to past timestamps for reproducible builds. Fixes [#763](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/763). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)
- **CI status with URL-based pushremote**: CI detection now works when `branch.<name>.pushremote` is set to a URL directly (as `gh pr checkout` does) instead of a remote name. ([#769](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/769))
- **GitLab nested groups in URL parsing**: URLs like `gitlab.com/group/subgroup/repo` now correctly identify `repo` as the repository name instead of `subgroup`. This was a security fix — previously, approval bypass was possible across sibling repos in the same parent group. ([#768](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/768))
- **GitLab CI status detection**: Fixed multiple issues with `glab` CLI compatibility — MR lookup now uses two-step resolution, "manual" pipelines show as running instead of failed, and rate limit errors are handled properly. Fixes [#764](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/764). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)

### Internal

- Refactored accessor functions to use bare nouns per Rust convention. ([#765](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/765))
- Clarified target/integration naming across codebase. ([#755](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/755))

## 0.17.0

### Improved

- **Per-project config overrides** (Experimental): Override settings per-project in user config. Supports `worktree-path`, `commit-generation`, `list`, `commit`, and `merge` sections. Config precedence: CLI arg > project config > global config > default. Closes [#596](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/596). ([#749](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/749))
- **Search all remotes for branch existence**: Branch existence checks and completions now search all remotes instead of just the primary remote, matching git's behavior. When a branch exists on multiple remotes, completions show all of them (e.g., `feature ⇣ 2d origin, upstream`). ([#744](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/744))
- **CI detection for fork workflows**: CI status detection now searches all remotes and uses `gh config get git_protocol` / `glab config get git_protocol` for fork URL protocol preference instead of inferring from existing remotes. ([#753](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/753))

### Fixed

- **Same-repo PR switching with stale refs**: `wt switch pr:N` for same-repo PRs now fetches the branch before validation, fixing "Branch not found" errors when local refs were stale. ([#742](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/742))
- **Project identifier collision for repos without remotes**: Repos without remotes now use their full canonical path as the project identifier instead of just the directory name, preventing approval collisions between unrelated repos (e.g., `~/work/myproject` vs `~/personal/myproject`). Users with remoteless repos will need to re-approve commands. ([#747](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/747))

### Internal

- Cross-platform path handling improvements using `path-slash` crate and `Path::file_name()`. ([#750](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/750))
- Renamed `WorktrunkConfig` to `UserConfig` internally. ([#746](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/746))

## 0.16.0

### Improved

- **Background hook verbosity**: Background hooks (post-start, post-switch) now show a single-line summary by default instead of per-hook output. Use `-v` to see detailed output with expanded commands. We're open to feedback on this change — let us know in [#690](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/690). (thanks @clutchski for reporting)

### Internal

- Fixed dead Apple documentation link in copy-ignored rationale. ([#743](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/743))

## 0.15.5

### Fixed

- **Hook execution order**: Hooks now run in the order defined in the config file. Previously, HashMap iteration randomized the order. Fixes [#737](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/737). (thanks @ngotchac for reporting)

## 0.15.4

### Improved

- **Git progress for slow worktree creation**: When `git worktree add` takes more than 400ms (common on large repos), worktrunk now shows a progress message and streams git's output instead of going silent. ([#725](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/725))
- **Verbose template expansion output**: `-v` now shows template expansion details: the template, expanded command, and any undefined variables with SemiStrict fallback behavior. ([#712](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/712))
- **Shell integration hint for explicit path invocation**: When running wt via explicit path (e.g., `./target/debug/wt`) with shell integration configured, the warning now suggests running `wt switch <branch>` to use the shell-wrapped command. ([#721](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/721))

### Fixed

- **Unsafe upstream when creating branch from remote base**: `wt switch --create feature --base=origin/main` no longer sets up tracking to origin/main, preventing accidental pushes to the base branch. Fixes [#713](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/713). (thanks @kfirba)
- **Credential redaction in debug logs**: URLs with embedded credentials (e.g., `https://token@github.com/...`) are now redacted in `-vv` debug output. ([#718](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/718))
- **Hook preview shows template on expansion failure**: `wt hook show --expanded` now displays both the error message and original template when expansion fails, instead of hiding the template. ([#722](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/722))

### Documentation

- **Homebrew install uses core tap**: Install command updated from `max-sixty/worktrunk/wt` to `worktrunk`. ([#716](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/716), thanks @chenrui333)
- **Hook docs reordered**: post-start (background) is now the recommended default, with post-create for blocking dependencies. ([#733](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/733))

### Internal

- Simplified GitHub/GitLab CI status detection. ([#730](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/730))
- Previous worktree gutter changed from `-` to `+` for visual consistency. ([#699](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/699))

## 0.15.3

### Fixed

- **`--execute` command display**: Shows the expanded command in a gutter with path context instead of showing the raw template before expansion. ([#708](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/708))
- **CRLF line endings in error display**: Multiline errors with Windows (`\r\n`) or old Mac (`\r`) line endings now display correctly instead of falling through to single-line handling. ([#707](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/707))

### Documentation

- **Arch Linux install via AUR**: Added installation instructions and shell integration command. ([#709](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/709), [#561](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/561), thanks @razor-x)

## 0.15.2

### Improved

- **`wt config shell completions <shell>`**: Generate static shell completion scripts for package managers and custom installation. ([#701](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/701), thanks @chenrui333)
- **Debug logging threshold**: Now requires `-vv` instead of `-v` for debug logging and diagnostic file generation, freeing `-v` for future use. ([#702](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/702))

### Fixed

- **Fork PR fetching**: `wt switch pr:N` now works when `origin` points to a fork by fetching PR refs from the upstream remote. Shows actionable error with `git remote add` command if upstream remote is missing. ([#704](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/704))
- **Fork PR branch naming**: Fork PR branches now use the original branch name (e.g., `feature-fix`) instead of `owner/feature-fix`, so `git push` works correctly. ([#706](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/706))
- **Config race conditions**: File locking prevents corruption when multiple `wt` processes modify config simultaneously. ([#693](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/693))
- **Nested worktree detection**: Current worktree indicator (`@`) now shows on the correct worktree when worktrees are nested (e.g., `.worktrees/` layout inside repo). ([#697](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/697))
- **Symlink path resolution**: Worktree commands work correctly on systems with symlinks (e.g., macOS `/var` → `/private/var`). ([#696](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/696))
- **Pre-remove hook failures**: Shell no longer cd's to main worktree when pre-remove hooks fail, leaving user in their current location. ([#692](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/692))
- **PowerShell completion robustness**: Completion registration errors no longer break the shell wrapper function. ([#674](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/674))

### Documentation

- Added missing `orphan` (`∅`) symbol and `no_worktree` state to JSON output documentation. ([#687](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/687))
- Clarified Unicode handling in shell detection. ([#700](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/700))

### Internal

- Refactored large files into focused modules. ([#688](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/688))
- Consolidated integration reason computation into Repository method. ([#689](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/689))
- Added verbose level tracking infrastructure for future `-v` output. ([#703](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/703))
- PowerShell template uses `WORKTRUNK_BIN` for test isolation. ([#674](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/674))

## 0.15.1

### Improved

- **`wt config show` diagnostics**: When shell integration is not active, now shows how the command was invoked, the binary path (if different), and `$SHELL` environment variable. Helps diagnose setup issues. ([#683](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/683))
- **Help pager follows git convention**: `-h` never opens a pager, `--help` uses pager when available. Closes [#583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/583). ([#651](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/651), thanks @razor-x)
- **Verbose mode logging**: `-v` now logs command stdout/stderr and all spawned processes including background hooks, `wt for-each` commands, and shell probes. ([#680](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/680))

### Documentation

- **FAQ reordered**: Questions now ordered by frequency and importance.

### Internal

- **AUR package**: Worktrunk now published to Arch Linux AUR on each release. ([#585](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/585), thanks @razor-x)
- **Codecov Test Analytics**: Integration tests now report to Codecov Test Analytics. ([#682](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/682))

## 0.15.0

### Improved

- **`wt switch pr:<number>` syntax** (experimental): Switch directly to a GitHub PR by number. Same-repo PRs delegate to normal switch flow; fork PRs fetch from refs/pull/N/head and configure pushRemote. ([#673](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/673), closes [#657](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/657), thanks @wladpaiva for requesting)
- **`--force` hint for dirty worktrees**: When `wt remove` fails due to uncommitted changes, the hint now shows the full command: `wt remove <branch> --force`. ([#671](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/671))

### Documentation

- **Windows install guidance**: Winget as recommended install (ships `git-wt` by default), plus the App Execution Aliases workaround to use `wt` directly. Closes [#133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/133). (thanks @ctolkien for reporting, @shanselman for the aliases tip, @Farley-Chen for [#648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/648))
- **Caddy subdomain routing pattern**: Clean URLs like `feature-auth.myproject.lvh.me` via Caddy reverse proxy with dynamic route registration.
- **tmux session per worktree pattern**: Dedicated tmux session with multi-pane layout per worktree.

## 0.14.2

### Fixed

- **`wt remove --force` works with dirty worktrees**: The `--force` flag was documented to allow removal with uncommitted changes, but worktrunk's own cleanliness check blocked it before git could apply the flag. Fixes [#658](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/658). (thanks @pedro93)
- **Correct output when switching to existing local branch**: When switching to a local branch that tracks a remote, worktrunk incorrectly reported "Created branch X" instead of "Created worktree for X". Now only reports branch creation when git's DWIM actually creates a new tracking branch from a remote. Fixes [#656](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/656). (thanks @guidupuy-ws)
- **PowerShell handles multiple `wt.exe` binaries**: On Windows, when both Windows Terminal's `wt.exe` and worktrunk's `wt.exe` exist in PATH, shell integration errored with "Cannot convert 'System.Object[]' to the type 'System.String'". Now correctly uses the first match. Relates to [#648](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/648). (thanks @Farley-Chen)

## 0.14.1

### Improved

- **`--base` accepts commit-ish refs**: `wt switch --create --base` now accepts HEAD, tags, commit SHAs, and relative refs (e.g., `HEAD~2`), not just branch names. Fixes [#630](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/630). (thanks @myhau)
- **Upfront validation for target refs**: `wt merge` and `wt step` commands now validate target refs before approval prompts, giving clearer "Branch X not found" errors immediately.
- **Visual hierarchy in help**: Section dividers, improved heading structure, and sentence case in `--help` output.

### Fixed

- **macOS shell freeze during `copy-ignored`**: Atomic `clonefile()` on directories saturated disk I/O, blocking shell startup. Now uses per-file reflink which is slower but keeps the system responsive.
- **`copy-ignored` no longer copies nested worktrees**: When `worktree-path` places worktrees inside the main worktree, `copy-ignored` now skips them. Also now copies symlinks (fixes `node_modules/.bin/` etc.). Fixes [#641](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/641). (thanks @razor-x)
- **Context-aware hints for `wt config create`**: Hints now suggest relevant next steps based on which configs exist.

## 0.14.0

### Improved

- **`worktree_path_of_branch(branch)` template function**: Look up the filesystem path of any branch's worktree in hooks. Enables copying files between worktrees: `setup = "cp {{ worktree_path_of_branch('main') }}/config.local {{ worktree_path }}"`. Returns empty string if no worktree exists for the branch.
- **Per-task timeout for `wt list`**: Configure timeout for git operations via `[list] timeout-ms` in user config. Shows timeout count in footer. Use `--full` to disable timeout for complete data collection.
- **Atomic COW directory cloning on macOS**: `wt step copy-ignored` uses `clonefile()` syscall on APFS for O(1) directory cloning instead of file-by-file copying. ~12-15x faster for large directories like `target/`.
- **Template variable renamed**: `main_worktree_path` → `primary_worktree_path` for clarity. Old name still works with deprecation warning.

### Fixed

- **`wt step copy-ignored` in bare repositories**: Fixed "this operation must be run in a work tree" error when using bare repo setups. Closes [#598](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/598). (thanks @sbennett33 for reporting)

### Internal

- **Help system extraction**: Moved help and invocation utilities from main.rs to dedicated modules.
- **`wt list` model refactor**: Split monolithic model.rs into modular directory structure.

## 0.13.4

### Fixed

- **LESS flag concatenation with long options**: Fixed "invalid option" error when users have long options in LESS (e.g., `LESS=--mouse`). The pager auto-quit feature from v0.13.1 now correctly separates flags. Fixes [#594](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/594). (thanks @tnlanh for reporting)

### Internal

- **Homebrew formula generation**: Release workflow now uses cargo-dist for Homebrew formula generation, simplifying the release process.

## 0.13.2

### Improved

- **Validate before approval prompts**: `wt switch` and `wt remove` now validate operations before prompting for hook approval, so users don't approve hooks for operations that will fail.

### Fixed

- **Homebrew formula SHA256 hashes**: Fixed release workflow that was setting incorrect checksums for Intel and Linux binaries, causing `brew install` to fail. Fixes [#589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/589). (thanks @kobrigo for reporting)

## 0.13.1

### Fixed

- **Pager auto-quit**: Help text now auto-quits when it fits on screen, even when `LESS` is set without the `F` flag (common with oh-my-zsh's `LESS=-R` default). Fixes [#583](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/583). (thanks @razor-x for reporting)
- **`--create` hint for remote branch shadowing**: Improved recovery hint when `--create` shadows a remote branch — now shows the full recovery command.

## 0.13.0

### Improved

- **`wt list` parallelization improvements**: Better parallelization of worktree operations reduce latency in some conditions. Respects `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` environment variable for controlling parallelism.
- **Template variables in `--execute`**: Hook template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree_path }}`, etc.) are now expanded in `--execute` commands and trailing args. With `--create`, `{{ base }}` and `{{ base_worktree_path }}` are also available.
- **Fish shell Homebrew compatibility**: Fish shell integration now installs to `~/.config/fish/functions/wt.fish` instead of `conf.d/`, ensuring PATH is fully configured before the wt function loads. `wt config show` detects legacy installations and `wt config shell install` handles migration automatically. ([#586](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/586) — thanks @ekans & @itzlambda)
- **Chrome Trace Format export**: Performance traces can be exported for analysis with Chrome's trace viewer or Perfetto.
- **`--dry-run` flag for shell commands**: `wt config shell install` and `wt config shell uninstall` now support `--dry-run` to preview changes without prompting.
- **Nested subcommand suggestions**: When typing `wt squash` instead of `wt step squash`, the error now suggests the correct command path.
- **Orphan branch indicator**: `wt list` shows `∅` (empty set) for orphan branches with no common ancestor to the default branch.
- **Improved `-vv` diagnostic workflow**: Bug reporting hint now uses a gist workflow to avoid URL length limits.

### Fixed

- **`wt switch --create --base` error message**: Now correctly identifies the invalid base branch instead of the target branch. Fixes [#562](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/562). (thanks @fablefactor)
- **AheadBehind column loading indicator**: Shows `⋯` when not yet loaded instead of appearing empty, distinguishing loading state from "in sync".
- **Post-merge hook failure output**: Simplified error messages and removed confusing `--no-verify` hint.
- **`wt select` log preview**: Graph structure is now preserved when displaying commit history, and columns dynamically align.

### Documentation

- **FAQ entry for shell setup issues**: Added troubleshooting guidance for common shell integration problems.
- **Template variables reference**: Consolidated template variables documentation into hook.md.
- **Clarified `--force` vs `-D` flags**: Updated `wt remove` documentation. (thanks @hlee-cb)
- **Performance benchmarks**: Added documentation for `copy-ignored` performance.

## 0.12.0

### Improved

- **`wt select --branches` and `--remotes` flags**: Control which items appear in the selection UI. Shares the `[list]` config section with `wt list` for consistent defaults.
- **Graceful degradation when default branch unavailable**: When the default branch cannot be determined (e.g., misconfigured), `wt list` shows warnings and empty cells rather than failing. `wt switch --create` without `--base` gives a clear error message.
- **Remove `--refresh` flag from state commands**: `wt config state default-branch get` and `wt config state ci-status get` now purely read cached state. To force re-detection, use the explicit workflow: `clear` then `get`. (Breaking: `--refresh` flag removed)
- **Windows: Require Git for Windows**: Removed PowerShell fallback. Worktrunk now requires Git for Windows (Git Bash) and shows a clear error message pointing to the download page if not found. (Breaking: PowerShell no longer supported)

### Fixed

- **Flag styling in messages**: Flags like `--clobber` and `--no-verify` in parentheses now inherit message color instead of using bright-black styling.
- **Nix flake**: Remove apple_sdk framework dependency. ([#525](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/525), thanks @MattiasMTS)
- **`gh issue create` hint**: Now includes `--web` flag to open the issue form in browser.

### Internal

- **Binary size reduced ~1MB**: Trimmed unused config/minijinja features (13MB → 12MB).
- **Repository module split**: Split 2200-line module into 8 focused submodules for maintainability.

## 0.11.0

### Improved

- **Nix flake for packaging**: New `flake.nix` for Nix users with crane for efficient Rust builds. ([#502](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/502), thanks @marktoda; thanks @Kabilan108 for requesting)
- **`sanitize_db` template filter**: New filter that transforms strings into database-safe identifiers with a 3-character hash suffix for collision/keyword safety. ([#498](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/498), thanks @hugobarauna for requesting)
- **`wt select` performance**: 500ms timeout for git commands improves TUI responsiveness on large repos with many branches. (thanks @KidkArolis for reporting [#461](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/461))
- **`wt select` stale branch handling**: Branches 50+ commits behind the default branch now skip expensive operations, showing `...` in the diff column. Improves performance on repos with many stale branches.
- **Global merge-base cache**: Cached merge-base results improve `wt list` performance by avoiding redundant git calls.
- **`wt config show` git version**: Now displays the git version alongside the worktrunk version.
- **`wt step copy-ignored` default**: Now copies all gitignored files by default. Use `.worktreeinclude` to limit what gets copied (previously required `.worktreeinclude` to specify what to copy).
- **Trace log analysis**: New `analyze-trace` binary for analyzing `[wt-trace]` performance logs.

### Fixed

- **Statusline truncation**: No longer truncates when terminal width is unknown, fixing Claude Code statusline display.
- **Shell completions**: Deprecated args like `--no-background` no longer appear in tab completions.
- **`wt remove` progress ordering**: Progress message now appears after pre-remove hooks, not before.
- **`wt list` index lock**: Uses `--no-optional-locks` for git status to avoid lock contention with parallel tasks.

## 0.10.0

### Improved

- **`wt step copy-ignored`**: Copy gitignored files listed in `.worktreeinclude` between worktrees. Useful for syncing `.env` files, IDE settings, and build caches to new worktrees via post-create hooks. Uses COW (reflink) copying for efficient handling of large directories. Matches Claude Code Desktop's worktree file syncing behavior.
- **`--foreground` flag**: Debug background hooks by running them in the foreground. Available on `wt hook post-start`, `wt hook post-switch`, and `wt remove`. Replaces the deprecated `--no-background` flag.
- **`--var` flag for hooks**: Override template variables when running hooks manually, e.g., `wt hook post-create --var target=main`.
- **`ci.platform` config**: Explicitly set CI platform (`github` or `gitlab`) for GitHub Enterprise or self-hosted GitLab where URL-based detection fails.
- **Upstream diff in `wt select`**: Tab 4 shows ahead/behind diff vs upstream tracking branch (remote⇅), matching the column in `wt list`.
- **`{{ base }}` and `{{ base_worktree_path }}` variables**: New template variables for creation hooks (post-create, post-start, post-switch) to access the base branch name and worktree path.
- **`-vv` diagnostic reports**: Double-verbose flag writes a diagnostic report to `.git/wt-logs/diagnostic.md` with environment info, configs, and logs for easy bug reporting.

### Fixed

- **Warning ordering**: Warnings about state discovered during evaluation now appear before the action message, making them feel like considered observations rather than afterthoughts.
- **Config validation in `wt config show`**: Now validates TOML syntax and schema, displaying parse errors with details.

### Documentation

- **Undocumented features**: Added documentation for `--show-prompt` and `--stage` flags on `wt step commit/squash`, `skip-shell-integration-prompt` config, and `[select] pager` config.

## 0.9.5

### Improved

- **Pager config for `wt select`**: New `[select] pager` config option to customize the diff pager in `wt select` previews. Auto-detects delta/bat when not configured.
- **Infinity symbol for extreme diffs**: `wt list` shows `∞` instead of `9K` for diffs >= 10,000 commits, avoiding misleading values.

### Fixed

- **Windows shell integration message**: Warning now shows just the command name instead of the full absolute path, and gives targeted advice when only the `.exe` suffix differs.
- **URL column width**: Column width in `wt list` now accounts for hyperlink display showing just `:PORT` instead of full URLs.

### Internal

- **Deprecated `template-file` and `squash-template-file`**: Legacy LLM template config options now show deprecation warnings.
- **Path handling improvements**: Replaced string manipulation with proper Path/PathBuf stdlib methods throughout the codebase.

## 0.9.4

### Improved

- **Diagnostic report generation**: `wt list --verbose` generates diagnostic reports (`.git/wt-logs/diagnostic.md`) when warnings or errors occur, with a `gh issue create` command hint when GitHub CLI is available.
- **Alias bypass detection**: `wt config show` detects shell aliases that point to binary paths (e.g., `alias gwt="/usr/bin/wt"`) and warns that they bypass shell integration with suggested fixes.
- **Switch message clarity**: Messages now explicitly state what was created — "Created branch X and worktree" vs "Created worktree for X" vs "Switched to worktree for X".
- **Worktree-path hint**: One-time hint after first `wt switch --create` suggesting `wt config create` to customize worktree locations.
- **Path mismatch warnings**: `wt remove` and `wt merge` show warnings when worktree paths don't match the config template.
- **CLI command ordering**: Commands reordered by usage frequency in `--help` (switch, list, remove, merge...).

### Fixed

- **Progress counter overflow**: Fixed `wt list` progressive rendering when URL sends caused completed count to exceed expected count.
- **Windows shell integration**: Shell function now correctly strips `.exe` suffix, relying on MSYS2/Git Bash automatic resolution (fixes [#348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/348)).
- **Prunable worktrees**: Gracefully handle worktrees where the directory was deleted but git still tracks metadata.
- **Help text tables**: Disabled clap text wrapping to preserve markdown tables in `--help` output.

### Documentation

- **FAQ entries**: Added entries for "What files does Worktrunk create?" and "What can Worktrunk delete?".

### Internal

- **Hint state management**: New `wt config state hints` subcommand for viewing and clearing shown hints.
- **Deprecated config deduplication**: Migration files (`.new`) only written once per repo, tracked via git config hints.

## 0.9.3

### Improved

- **Terminal hyperlinks for URLs**: The URL column in `wt list` now shows clickable links (OSC 8) in supported terminals, displaying a compact `:port` that links to the full URL.
- **Statusline truncation**: Statusline output now intelligently truncates by dropping low-priority segments (URL, CI) before high-priority ones (branch, model) when exceeding terminal width.
- **Statusline URL**: When a project has a `[list] url` template configured, the URL now appears in statusline output for shell prompts.
- **Bare repo default branch detection**: Uses `symbolic-ref HEAD` as a heuristic for detecting the default branch in bare repos and empty repos before the first commit.
- **Terminology**: Renamed "path mismatch" to "branch-worktree mismatch" for clarity. In JSON output (`wt list --format=json`), the field `path_mismatch` is now `branch_worktree_mismatch`.

### Fixed

- **Empty bare repo bootstrap**: `wt switch --create main` now works in empty bare repos by handling unborn branches correctly.

### Documentation

- **CLI help text**: Improved descriptions across multiple commands including `wt`, `wt list`, `wt select`, `wt step`, `wt merge`, `wt remove`, and `wt hook`.
- **Web docs copy button**: Fixed copy button position so it stays at top-right when scrolling horizontally through code blocks.

### Internal

- **Claude Code plugin detection**: `wt config show` now displays whether the worktrunk Claude Code plugin is installed, with install hints if needed.
- **Hyperlink diagnostics**: `wt config show` shows hyperlink support status (active/inactive).

## 0.9.2

### Fixed

- **Locked worktree detection**: `wt remove` now detects locked worktrees upfront and shows a clear error with unlock instructions, instead of reporting success but silently failing. ([#408](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/408), [#412](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/412))
- **Windows Git Bash shell integration**: Shell detection now handles Windows-style paths in `$SHELL` (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\bash.exe`). Fixes [#348](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/348). ([#398](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/398))

### Documentation

- **CLI help text clarity**: Improved descriptions for `wt`, `wt list`, `wt step push`, `wt step squash`, `wt remove`, and `wt config state`. ([#410](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/410))
- **Installation commands**: Removed `$` prefixes from install commands for easier copy-paste. ([#405](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/405), thanks @muzzlol)

### Internal

- **Home worktree lookup**: Centralized with `find_home()` and `home_path()` methods for more consistent behavior with bare repos.
- **Windows CI**: Added cross-platform mock infrastructure for testing Windows-specific behavior.

## 0.9.1

### Improved

- **Shell integration debug info**: `wt config show` now displays invocation details (path, git subcommand mode, explicit path usage) to help diagnose shell integration issues. "Shell integration not active" is now a warning instead of a hint.

## 0.9.0

### Improved

- **Shell integration prompt**: When shell integration isn't active after `wt switch`, an interactive prompt offers to install it. The prompt remembers your choice and falls back to a hint for non-TTY environments.
- **Template variable names**: Renamed for clarity: `repo_root` → `repo_path`, `worktree` → `worktree_path`, `main_worktree` → `repo`. Added `main_worktree_path` for accessing the main worktree's absolute path. Deprecated names work with migration warnings and auto-generated `.new` config files.
- **Shell integration warnings**: Specific diagnostic messages when shell cd won't work: "shell integration not installed", "shell requires restart", "ran ./wt; shell integration wraps wt", or "ran git wt; running through git prevents cd".
- **RUNTIME section in `wt config show`**: Displays binary name, version, and shell integration status to help debug invocation issues.
- **Clickable CI indicator**: The CI status indicator (●) in `wt list` output is now a clickable link to the PR in terminals that support OSC 8 hyperlinks.
- **`wt switch` help text**: Clarifies the difference from `git switch` and documents common failure conditions.

### Fixed

- **Hook path display**: Hook announcements show the execution path when shell integration isn't active.
- **Approval matching with deprecated vars**: Approvals now match regardless of whether they were saved with deprecated or current variable names.
- **Documentation filter syntax**: Fixed incorrect Jinja filter examples that showed `~` concatenation with `|` filter without parentheses. ([#373](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/373), thanks @coriocactus)

### Documentation

- **Pre-remove hook example**: Added pattern for cleaning up background processes (e.g., killing dev servers) when worktrees are removed.

## 0.8.5

### Improved

- **Windows `git-wt` command**: Winget now ships with `git-wt` as a workaround to the Windows Terminal `wt` naming conflict. We're still considering better options — see [#133](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/133).

## 0.8.4

### Improved

- **Shell integration detection**: More robust detection of `git wt` (space) vs `git-wt` patterns. `wt config show` now displays line numbers for detected shell integration.
- **Windows `wt select` error**: Shows a helpful error message with alternatives instead of "unrecognized subcommand".

### Fixed

- **Markdown table rendering**: Escaped pipe characters (`\|`) in help output now render correctly.
- **Dim styling on wrapped lines**: Dim text attribute now preserved on continuation lines when text wraps.
- **Path occupied hint**: Fixed tilde expansion issue where `~/...` paths didn't work in shell commands.

### Documentation

- **Hook design guide**: Added comprehensive guide for designing hooks.
- **Command docs**: Added `wt config show` to command documentation.
- **Windows paths**: Documented MSYS2 auto path conversion for Windows shell integration.

### Internal

- **Output system**: Consolidated output functions, removed redundant aliases.
- **Zsh compinit**: Improved handling of "insecure directories" warning in tests.

## 0.8.3

### Improved

- **Hook execution path**: Shows the execution path when post-merge hooks run in a different directory than where the user invoked the command (e.g., with `--no-remove`).
- **TTY check for `wt select`**: Now fails gracefully when run in a non-interactive terminal instead of hanging.
- **Background hooks**: `post-start` and `post-switch` hooks spawn in background via stdin piping, matching their normal behavior during `wt switch`.
- **Occupied path error message**: When a worktree path is occupied by a different branch, the error now explains the situation clearly and suggests `git switch`.
- **Shell integration hint**: Shows a hint to restart the shell when shell integration is configured but not active.
- **Message style**: Removed 2nd person pronouns ("you/your") from user-facing messages following CLI guidelines.

### Fixed

- **`wt hook post-start` blocking**: Fixed bug where `wt hook post-start` ran in foreground blocking the command, instead of spawning in background like during normal `wt switch --create`.
- **Approval bypass with `project:` prefix**: Fixed security issue where using `project:` filter prefix (e.g., `wt hook pre-merge project:`) bypassed the approval check, allowing unapproved project commands to run.

### Documentation

- **License file**: Added combined MIT and Apache-2.0 license file.
- **Demo GIFs**: Added demo GIFs to command pages on the documentation site.
- **Install instructions**: Simplified to single-line commands.

### Internal

- **Pre-commit hooks**: Updated to immutable tags.
- **Lychee exclusions**: Cleaned up link checker configuration.

## 0.8.2

### Improved

- **Concurrent hook execution**: `wt hook post-start` and `wt hook post-switch` now run all commands concurrently (matching their normal background behavior) instead of sequentially with fail-fast. Multiple failures are collected and reported together.

### Documentation

- **Nested bare repo layout**: Added worktree-path template example for nested bare repo layout (`project/.git` pattern). Uses relative paths like `../{{ branch | sanitize }}` to create worktrees as siblings to the .git directory.

## 0.8.1

### Improved

- **Shell and PowerShell installers**: Added one-line install commands for Linux/macOS and Windows.
- **Consistent terminology**: CLI now uses "branch name" consistently instead of mixing "worktree" and "branch". The `wt remove` argument is renamed from `worktrees` to `branches` to reflect that worktrees are addressed by branch name.

### Fixed

- **Switch hints**: Removed incorrect `wt switch @` hint and improved error output spacing.

### Documentation

- **Dev server and database patterns**: Added practical examples for running per-worktree dev servers with subdomain routing and databases with unique ports.

## 0.8.0

### Improved

- **Separate `--yes` and `--force` flags**: `--force/-f` renamed to `--yes/-y` for skipping prompts (all commands). New `--force/-f` on `wt remove` forces removal of worktrees with untracked files (build artifacts, node_modules, etc.). (Breaking: `--force` no longer skips prompts; use `--yes`)
- **Clearer branch deletion output**: `wt remove` output now shows "worktree & branch" when the branch is deleted, or plain "worktree" with a hint when kept. Makes scanning output for branch fate easier.
- **`post-switch` hook on remove**: When `wt remove` switches to the main worktree, post-switch hooks now run in the destination.
- **Allow merge commits by default**: `wt step push` no longer rejects history with merge commits. Removed `--allow-merge-commits` flag. (Breaking: flag removed)

### Fixed

- **Orphan branches in `wt list`**: Branches with no common ancestor with the default branch no longer cause errors.
- **Remote branch filtering**: `wt list --remotes` now filters out branches that are tracked as upstreams, not just branches with worktrees.
- **Error message spacing**: Reduced double-newline spacing in error messages.

## 0.7.0

### Improved

- **Working tree conflict detection**: `wt list --full` now detects conflicts using uncommitted working tree changes, not just committed content. This catches conflicts earlier—before committing changes that would conflict with the target branch.
- **Dev server URL column**: New optional URL column in `wt list` configured via `[list] url` template in project config (`.config/wt.toml`). URLs show with health-check styling: normal if the port is listening, dimmed otherwise.
- **Shell integration simplification**: The shell wrapper is now self-contained with all directive handling inlined. Removes the separate helper function that could become unavailable if shell initialization order changed.
- **Performance**: Repository caching reduces git subprocess spawns; parallelized pre-skeleton operations for faster initial display.
- **Improved error hints**: When a worktree path already exists during creation, the error hint now correctly suggests `--create --clobber`.

### Fixed

- **Docs syntax highlighting**: Fixed syntax highlighting colors being stripped by 1Password browser extension on the documentation site.

## 0.6.1

### Improved

- **`post-switch` hook**: New hook that runs in the background after every `wt switch` operation. Unlike `post-start` (which only runs on creation), `post-switch` runs on all switch results. Use cases include renaming terminal tabs, updating tmux window names, and IDE notifications.
- **Signal forwarding for hooks**: Hooks now receive SIGINT/SIGTERM when the parent process is interrupted, allowing proper cleanup. Previously, non-interactive shells continued executing after signals.
- **Faster `wt list` skeleton**: Time-to-skeleton reduced by caching default branch lookup, batching timestamp fetching, and deferring non-essential git operations. Skeleton shows `·` placeholder for gutter symbols until data loads.
- **Clearer `--clobber` hint**: Error message now says "to overwrite (with backup)" instead of "to retry with backup".

### Documentation

- **State side-effects**: Added section explaining how Worktrunk state operations may trigger git commands.
- **`wt merge` location**: Clarified that `wt merge` runs from the feature worktree.

## 0.6.0

### Improved

- **Single-width Unicode symbols**: Replaced emojis (🔄, ✅, ❌) with single-width Unicode symbols (◎, ✓, ✗, ▲, ↳, ○, ❯) for better terminal compatibility and consistent alignment.
- **Output system overhaul**: Clean separation of output channels (data→stdout, status→stderr, directives→file) means piping works with shell integration active. `wt list --format=json | jq` and `wt switch feature | tee log.txt` both work correctly. Background processes use `process_group(0)` instead of `nohup` for more reliable detachment.
- **Trailing arguments for `--execute`**: `wt switch --execute` now accepts arguments after `--`, enabling shell aliases like `alias wsc='wt switch --create -x claude'` then `wsc feature -- 'implement login'`.
- **`hash_port` template filter**: `{{ branch | hash_port }}` hashes the branch name to a deterministic port number (10000-19999), useful for running dev servers without port conflicts.
- **`sanitize` template filter**: `{{ branch | sanitize }}` explicitly replaces `/` and `\` with `-` for filesystem-safe paths. (Breaking: `{{ branch }}` now provides raw branch names. Update templates that use `{{ branch }}` in filesystem paths to use `{{ branch | sanitize }}` instead)
- **Log directory in state output**: `wt config state logs` and `wt config state get` now show the log directory path under a LOG FILES heading.
- **Actionable error hints**: Error messages now include hints about what command to run next.
- **Unified directory change output**: `wt remove` now shows "Switched to worktree for {branch} @ {path}" matching `wt switch` format.
- **Consistent "already up to date" formatting**: Standardized message wording and styling across commands.

### Fixed

- **`wt step rebase` with merge commits**: Fixed incorrect "Already up-to-date" when a branch has merge commits from merging target into itself.

### Documentation

- **Local CI workflow**: Added "Local CI" section to `wt merge --help` explaining how pre-merge hooks enable faster iteration.
- **Colored command reference**: Web docs now preserve ANSI colors in command reference output.
- **Clarified terminology**: Help text uses "default branch" instead of hardcoded "main".

## 0.5.2

### Improved

- **`--clobber` flag for `wt switch`**: When encountering a stale directory or file at the target worktree path, `--clobber` moves it to a timestamped `.bak` file instead of failing.
- **Relative paths in `wt list`**: Paths are now shown relative to the main worktree (`.`, `./subdir`, `../repo.feature`) instead of a computed common prefix that could degenerate to `/`.
- **Multiline error formatting**: Errors with context now show a header describing what worktrunk was trying to do, with the full error chain in a gutter block.
- **Semantic switch messaging**: Switching to an existing worktree now shows ⚪ (info) instead of ✅ (success), reflecting that nothing was created.

### Fixed

- **Symbol styling in removal messages**: Integration symbols (`_`, `⊂`) now render in their canonical dim appearance instead of inheriting the message's cyan color.
- **ConflictingChanges error formatting**: Fixed double newlines in the error message output.

## 0.5.1

### Improved

- **Integration status in removal messages**: Shows integration symbols (`_` for same commit, `⊂` for integrated) when removing worktrees, matching `wt list` display.
- **Concurrent command limiting**: Limits concurrent git processes to 32 (configurable via `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS`), preventing resource exhaustion on repos with many branches.
- **Better error display for `wt list`**: Task errors are now collected and displayed as warnings after the table renders, instead of being silently swallowed.
- **Remove continues on partial failures**: `wt remove` continues removing other worktrees when some fail, reporting all errors at the end.
- **Bash syntax highlighting**: Shell commands in error gutters now have syntax highlighting.
- **Shell integration is command-aware**: Detection and removal works correctly when installed as `git-wt` or other names.
- **CI fetch error documentation**: Yellow warning symbol (⚠) in CI column is now documented in help text.

### Fixed

- **CI status with multiple workflows**: Fixed incorrect status when multiple workflows exist (e.g., `ci` and `publish-docs`). Now uses GitHub's check-runs API to aggregate all workflow statuses.
- **State storage unification**: Unified branch-keyed state under `worktrunk.state.<branch>.*`. Numeric branch names now work. (Existing CI cache and markers regenerate on first access)

### Internal

- **Environment variable prefix**: Standardized to `WORKTRUNK_` prefix (e.g., `WORKTRUNK_MAX_CONCURRENT_COMMANDS`).
- Automatic winget package publishing on releases.

## 0.5.0

### Improved

- **Path column hidden when redundant**: Path column is deprioritized when all paths match the naming template, showing only at wider terminal widths (~125+ columns).
- **Better error formatting**: Errors with context now show a header with the root cause in a gutter block, improving readability for git errors.
- **Clearer integration target**: Separated `default_branch` (for stats like ahead/behind) from `target` (for integration checks), catching branches merged remotely before pulling.

### Fixed

- **Untracked files block integration**: Untracked files now prevent a worktree from being flagged as integrated, avoiding accidental data loss on removal.
- **Dirty worktree count includes untracked**: Summary now correctly counts worktrees with untracked files as dirty.
- **Branch name disambiguation**: Fixed `refname:short` issues when a branch and remote have the same name.
- **JSON output uses kebab-case**: Enum values changed from snake_case to kebab-case (e.g., `same_commit` → `same-commit`). (Breaking: scripts parsing JSON output may need updates)
- **Legacy marker format removed**: Plain-text markers no longer parsed. (Breaking: re-set markers with `wt config state marker set`)

### Internal

- **Unified command execution**: All external commands now go through `shell_exec::run()` for consistent logging and tracing.

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **`--no-rebase` flag for `wt merge`**: Fails early with a clear error if the branch is not already rebased onto target, rather than auto-rebasing. Useful for workflows that handle rebasing separately. ([#194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/194))

### Changed

- **Branch-first argument resolution**: `wt switch` and `wt remove` now check if the branch has a worktree anywhere before checking the expected path. If you type `wt switch foo`, you get branch foo's worktree, not whatever happens to be at the expected path. ([#197](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/197))

### Fixed

- **`--no-commit` incorrectly skipped rebasing**: `wt merge --no-commit` now correctly rebases before stopping (if needed), rather than skipping the rebase entirely. ([#194](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/194))
- **Pager for `wt config show --full`**: The pager now works correctly with the `--full` flag, showing diagnostics properly. ([#198](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/198))
- **Statusline stdin handling**: Fixed flaky behavior on Windows CI by using standard is_terminal() check instead of timeout-based approach. ([#210](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/210))

### Improved

- **Path-occupied error messages**: When `wt switch` can't create a worktree because the path exists, error messages now show which branch occupies the path and provide actionable commands to fix the situation. ([#195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/195), [#206](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/206), [#207](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/207))
- **Switch mismatch detection**: Better error messages when path/branch mismatches occur, with hints showing the expected path. ([#195](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/195))

## 0.3.1

### Fixed

- **Branch names with slashes**: Branch names like `fix/feature-name` no longer break git config markers. Slashes are now escaped for git config compatibility. ([#189](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/189), thanks @kyleacmooney)
- **stdin inheritance for `--execute`**: Interactive programs (vim, python -i, claude) now work correctly with `--execute` on non-Unix platforms. ([#191](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/191))
- **Filenames with spaces/newlines**: Git status parsing now handles filenames containing spaces and newlines correctly using NUL-separated output.
- **Concurrent approval race condition**: Multiple concurrent approval/revocation operations no longer overwrite each other. Approvals now reload from disk before saving.
- **Dirty worktrees incorrectly marked integrated**: Priority 5 integration check now requires clean working tree state, preventing worktrees with uncommitted changes from being flagged as safe to remove.
- **Type changes not detected as staged**: Index status check now recognizes file type changes (`T` status) as staged changes.
- **User hook failure strategy**: Hook failure strategy now correctly applies to user hooks instead of always using fail-fast.
- **Branch variable in detached HEAD**: `{{ branch }}` now correctly expands to "HEAD" in detached HEAD worktrees instead of "(detached)".

### Improved

- **Self-hosted GitLab support**: CI auth checks now detect the GitLab host from the remote URL, supporting self-hosted GitLab instances instead of always checking gitlab.com.
- **Platform-specific CI status**: `wt list --full` and `wt config show` now show only the relevant CI tool (GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) based on the repository's remote URL.
- **LLM error reproduction**: When LLM commands fail, error messages now show the full reproduction command (e.g., `wt step commit --show-prompt | llm`) for easier debugging.
- **Location format**: Messages now use `@` instead of `at` for location phrases (e.g., "Switched to feature @ /path").
- **Switch help text**: Clarified that `wt switch` creates worktrees automatically for existing branches, not just for new branches with `--create`.

## 0.3.0

### Added

- **`--show-prompt` flag for LLM commands**: `wt step commit --show-prompt` and `wt step squash --show-prompt` output the rendered LLM prompt without executing the command. Useful for debugging templates or manually piping to LLM tools. ([#187](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/187))
- **Diff size limits and diffstat for LLM prompts**: Large diffs (>400K chars) are progressively filtered—first removing lock files, then truncating to 50 lines/file, max 50 files. New `git_diff_stat` template variable shows line change statistics. ([#186](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/186))
- **`MainState::Empty` status**: New `_` symbol for clean same-commit branches (safe to delete), distinguished from `–` (en-dash) for same-commit branches with uncommitted changes. Previously, both showed `_`. Only Empty branches are dimmed and considered "potentially removable". ([#185](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/185))

### Changed

- **State subcommands default to `get`**: Running `wt config state default-branch` now defaults to `get`, making the command shorter. Use explicit `get` subcommand to access options like `--refresh` or `--branch`. ([#184](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/184))
- **Clearer integration reason messages**: Updated descriptions to be more precise—"same commit as" instead of "already in" for SameCommit, "ancestor of" for Ancestor, "no added changes" for NoAddedChanges, "tree matches" for TreesMatch.

## 0.2.1

### Changed

- **Unified state management**: `wt config var` and `wt config cache` replaced by `wt config state` with consistent get/set/clear semantics for all runtime state. New subcommands: `default-branch`, `ci-status`, `marker`, `logs`, `show`. ([#178](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/178))
- **Comprehensive state overview**: `wt config state show` displays all state (default branch, switch history, markers, CI cache, logs) with `--format=json` support. ([#180](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/180))

### Added

- **`git-wt` binary for Windows**: New `git-wt` binary avoids conflict with Windows Terminal's `wt` command. Build with `--features git-wt`. Shell init/install now accept `--cmd` to specify which binary name to use. ([#177](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/177))
- **Diffstat in select preview**: The log preview (Tab 2) in `wt select` now shows line change statistics (+N -M) matching `wt list`'s HEAD± column format. ([#179](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/179))

### Fixed

- **Windows compatibility**: Multiple test and runtime fixes for Windows including stdin timeout handling, path canonicalization, and cross-platform test behavior. ([#167](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/167), [#168](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/168), [#169](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/169), [#170](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/170), [#171](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/171), [#174](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/174), [#176](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/176))

## 0.1.21

### Fixed

- **Windows path handling in shell templates**: Fixed path quoting in hook templates on Windows by using `cygpath` to convert native Windows paths to POSIX format for Git Bash compatibility. Template variables like `{{ worktree }}` and `{{ repo_root }}` now work correctly. ([#161](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/161))
- **Hook errors show `--no-verify` hint**: When hooks fail during `wt merge`, `wt commit`, or `wt squash`, the error message now includes a hint about using `--no-verify` to skip hooks. ([4a89748](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/4a89748f))

## 0.1.20

### Changed

- **`--doctor` renamed to `--full`**: The `wt list --doctor` flag is now `wt list --full`. The new name better reflects that it shows extended information (binaries status, full diff stats). ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))
- **CLI binaries status in `wt config show --full`**: Shows installation and authentication status of `gh` and `glab` CLI tools in a new BINARIES section. ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))
- **CI tool hints**: `wt list --full` shows a hint when CI status is unavailable, with specific guidance on which CLI tool to install or authenticate. ([171952e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/171952ec))

### Fixed

- **GitHub StatusContext checks**: CI status now includes StatusContext checks (used by some CI systems like Jenkins, CircleCI, and external status checks) in addition to CheckRuns. ([690da88](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/690da889))
- **Windows Git Bash detection with WSL**: Fixed detection of Git Bash when WSL is installed. Previously, the WSL bash shim in PATH could be found instead of Git Bash, causing hook execution failures. ([b48b0ba](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b48b0ba7))

## 0.1.19

### Added

- **`wt step for-each` command**: Run commands across all worktrees sequentially. Supports template variables (`{{ branch }}`, `{{ worktree }}`, etc.) and JSON context on stdin. Example: `wt step for-each -- git pull --autostash`. ([#138](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/138))

### Changed

- **Content integration detection always enabled**: The `⊂` (content integrated) symbol now appears without requiring `--full`. Squash-merged branches are detected automatically. ([f39c442](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/f39c4428))
- **SIGINT forwarding**: Ctrl+C now properly terminates child processes in hooks, preventing orphaned background commands. ([#136](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/136))

### Fixed

- **Windows path handling**: Fixed path canonicalization issues on Windows that caused worktree detection failures. Uses `dunce` to handle Windows verbatim paths (`\\?\`) that git cannot process. ([#125](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/125))

## 0.1.18

### Added

- **Windows support**: Git Bash with PowerShell fallback enables worktrunk on Windows. Git Bash is preferred (same bash hook syntax across platforms); PowerShell works for basic commands with limitations. ([#122](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/122))
- **Winget publishing**: Release workflow now publishes to Windows Package Manager. ([079c9df](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/079c9df3))

### Changed

- **Approvals command moved**: `wt config approvals` is now `wt hook approvals` since approvals manage hook commands. ([b7b1b9e](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b7b1b9e3))
- **Approval prompts show templates**: Approval prompts now display command templates (what gets saved) rather than expanded values. ([2315d26](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/2315d268))
- **Preview mode renamed**: The `history` preview mode is now `log` for clarity. ([0461152](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/04611524))

### Fixed

- **PR/MR source filtering**: Filter PRs by source repository instead of author, fixing false matches when multiple users have PRs with the same branch name. ([e9ccdf7](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/e9ccdf77))

## 0.1.17

### Added

- **User-level hooks**: Define hooks in `~/.config/wt.toml` that run for all repositories. New `wt hook show` command displays configured hooks and their sources. ([#118](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/118))
- **SSH URL support**: Git SSH URLs (e.g., `git@github.com:user/repo.git`) now work correctly for remote operations and branch name escaping. ([92c2cef](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/92c2cef8))
- **Help text wrapping**: CLI help text now wraps to terminal width for better readability. ([fe981c2](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/fe981c2e))

### Changed

- **JSON output redesign**: `wt list --format=json` now outputs a query-friendly format. This is a breaking change for existing JSON consumers. ([236eae8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/236eae81))
- **Status symbols**: Reorganized status column symbols for better scannability. Same-commit now distinguished from ancestor in integration detection. ([5053af8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/5053af88), [a087962](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/a0879623))

### Fixed

- **ANSI state reset**: Reset terminal ANSI state before returning to shell, preventing color bleeding into subsequent commands. ([334f6d9](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/334f6d99))
- **Empty staging error**: Fail early with a clear error when trying to generate a commit message with nothing staged. ([b9522bc](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/b9522bc6))

## 0.1.16

### Added

- **Squash-merge integration detection**: Improved branch cleanup detection with four ordered checks to identify when branch content is already in the target branch. This enables accurate removal of squash-merged branches even after target advances. New status symbols: `·` for same commit, `⊂` for content integrated via different history. ([6325be2](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6325be28))
- **CI absence caching**: Cache "no CI found" results to avoid repeated API calls for branches without CI configured. Reduces unnecessary rate limit consumption. ([8db3928](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/8db39285))
- **Shell completion tests**: Black-box snapshot tests for zsh, bash, and fish completions that verify actual completion output. ([#117](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/117))

### Changed

- **Merge conflict indicator**: Changed from `⊘` to `⚔` (crossed swords) for better visual distinction from the rebase symbol. ([f3b96a8](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/f3b96a83))

### Documentation

- **Hook JSON context**: Document all JSON fields available to hooks on stdin with examples for Python and other languages. ([af80589](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/af805898))
- **CI caching**: Document that CI results are cached for 30-60 seconds and how to use `wt config cache` to manage the cache. ([4804913](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/48049132))
- **Status column clarifications**: Clarify that the Status column contains multiple subcolumns with priority ordering. ([1f9bb38](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/1f9bb38f))

## 0.1.15

### Added

- **`wt hook` command**: New command for running lifecycle hooks directly. Moved hook execution from `wt step` to `wt hook` for cleaner semantic separation. ([#113](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/113))
- **Named hook execution**: Run specific named commands with `wt hook <type> <name>` (e.g., `wt hook pre-merge test`). Includes shell completion for hook names from project config. ([#114](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/114))

### Fixed

- **Zsh completion syntax**: Fixed `_describe` syntax in zsh shell completions. ([6ae9d0f](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6ae9d0f9))
- **Fish shell wrapper**: Fixed stderr redirection in fish shell wrapper. ([0301d4b](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/0301d4bf))
- **CI status for local branches**: Only check CI for branches with upstream tracking configured. ([6273ccd](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/6273ccdb))
- **Git error messages**: Include executed git command in error messages for easier debugging. ([200eea4](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/commit/200eea43))

## 0.1.14

### Added

- **Pre-remove hook**: New `pre-remove` hook runs before worktree removal, enabling cleanup tasks like stopping devcontainers. Thanks to [@pwntester](https://github.com/pwntester) in [#101](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/101). ([#107](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/107))
- **JSON context on stdin**: Hooks now receive worktree context as JSON on stdin, enabling hooks in any language (Python, Node, Ruby, etc.) to access repo information. ([#109](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/109))
- **`wt config create --project`**: New flag to generate `.config/wt.toml` project config files directly. ([#110](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/110))

### Fixed

- **Shell completion bypass**: Fixed lazy shell completion to use `command` builtin, bypassing the shell function that was causing `_clap_dynamic_completer_wt` errors. Thanks to [@cquiroz](https://github.com/cquiroz) in [#102](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/102). ([#105](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/105))
- **Remote-only branch completions**: `wt remove` completions now exclude remote-only branches (which can't be removed) and show a helpful error with hint to use `wt switch`. ([#108](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/108))
- **Detached HEAD hooks**: Pre-remove hooks now work correctly on detached HEAD worktrees. ([#111](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/111))
- **Hook `{{ target }}` variable**: Fixed template variable expansion in standalone hook execution. ([#106](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/pull/106))
