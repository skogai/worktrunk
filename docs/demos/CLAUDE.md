# Demo Development

## Directory structure

```
docs/demos/
  build            # Unified build script
  tapes/           # All VHS tape files (templated)
  shared/          # Python library, themes, fixtures
  vhs-keystrokes/  # Custom VHS binary (gitignored, built on demand)

docs/static/assets/  # Output GIFs (gitignored, shared with fetch-assets)
  docs/            # Doc site demos (1600x900)
    light/         # Light theme variants
    dark/          # Dark theme variants
  social/          # Social media demos (1200x700)
    light/         # Light theme only
```

Tape files use template variables (`{{FONTSIZE}}`, `{{WIDTH}}`, `{{HEIGHT}}`) so the same tape produces different sizes for docs vs social.

## Regenerating demos

```bash
./docs/demos/build docs      # Doc site demos (1600x900, light + dark)
./docs/demos/build social    # Social media demos (1200x700, light only)
./docs/demos/build docs --text  # Text output instead of GIFs
```

Text output captures terminal frames as plain text. Works for all demos, though interactive demos (TUI navigation, Zellij tabs) produce less useful output since the visual interactions don't translate to text.

Regenerate a single demo:

```bash
./docs/demos/build social --only wt-switch
./docs/demos/build docs --only wt-merge
```

**Available demos:**

| Target | Demos |
|--------|-------|
| docs | wt-core, wt-switch, wt-list, wt-commit, wt-statusline, wt-merge, wt-switch-picker, wt-zellij-omnibus |
| social | wt-switch, wt-statusline, wt-list, wt-list-remove, wt-hooks, wt-devserver, wt-commit, wt-merge, wt-switch-picker, wt-core, wt-zellij-omnibus |

## Snapshot testing

```bash
./docs/demos/build docs --snapshot           # Generate all snapshots
./docs/demos/build docs --snapshot --only wt-list  # Single demo
```

Snapshots capture command output (not terminal rendering) and are committed to `docs/demos/snapshots/`. Use them to catch regressions like new hints creeping in.

**How to use:**
1. After changing wt output, regenerate snapshots: `./docs/demos/build docs --snapshot`
2. Review the diff - small changes (commit hashes, minor formatting) are expected
3. Commit the updated snapshots alongside your changes

**What changes are expected:**
- Commit hashes change each run (demo repo is recreated)
- Column widths may shift slightly

**What changes indicate regressions:**
- New hints or warnings appearing
- Output format changes you didn't intend
- New lines or missing output

**TUI demo validation:**

TUI demos (Zellij, Claude UI) can't use text snapshots because VHS only captures the outer terminal, not content inside terminal multiplexers. Instead, they use OCR-based validation:

1. After recording, specific frames are extracted from the GIF using ffmpeg
2. Tesseract OCR extracts text from those frames
3. The text is validated for expected/forbidden patterns
4. Validation runs automatically when building TUI demos with defined checkpoints

Checkpoints are defined in `docs/demos/shared/validation.py`. To add validation to a TUI demo:
1. Identify key frame numbers by examining the GIF (30fps, so frame 90 = 3 seconds)
2. Define checkpoint patterns in `validation.py` with frame numbers, expected patterns, and forbidden patterns

Currently `wt-zellij-omnibus` has checkpoints; other TUI demos are skipped until checkpoints are added.

**Prerequisites for TUI validation:** `ffmpeg` and `tesseract` must be installed.

**Limitations:**
- Tab completion sequences are not replayed; only `Type "command"` + `Enter` patterns are extracted
- TUI demos without defined checkpoints are skipped
- OCR accuracy depends on font rendering quality

## Prerequisites

**Requires Go** — The VHS fork is built from source ([install Go](https://go.dev/dl/)).

**Requires ffmpeg with libass** — The keystroke overlay uses ASS subtitles. The build script checks for this and exits with install instructions if missing. Homebrew's API-sourced bottle omits `libass`; install from the tap formula instead:

```bash
HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1 brew install --build-from-source ffmpeg
```

External dependencies are downloaded/built automatically on first run:
- **VHS** — Custom fork with keystroke overlay (cloned and built from source)
- **Claude Code binary** — Downloaded from Anthropic's release bucket
- **Zellij plugin** — Downloaded from GitHub releases

Demos that launch Claude Code (wt-switch, wt-statusline, wt-zellij-omnibus) require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

This uses a small amount of API credits per recording (Claude starts, renders its UI, then exits).

## Publishing demos

After building, publish to the assets repo:

```bash
task publish-assets
```

This copies `docs/static/assets/{docs,social}/` to the `worktrunk-assets` repo (sibling directory), commits, and pushes. The script clones the repo via `gh` if missing.

To fetch published assets (without rebuilding):

```bash
task fetch-assets
```

Both build and fetch output to the same location (`docs/static/assets/`), so local builds override fetched assets.

## Modifying the VHS fork

The VHS fork is cloned to `docs/demos/.deps/vhs/` and built automatically. To modify it:

```bash
# 1. Make changes in the cloned repo
cd docs/demos/.deps/vhs
# ... edit files ...

# 2. Rebuild and test
go build -o vhs .
cd ../../../..
./docs/demos/build docs --only wt-switch-picker

# 3. Commit and push to the fork
cd docs/demos/.deps/vhs
git add -A
git commit -m "Description"
git push origin keypress-overlay
```

**CRITICAL**: Push changes to `origin keypress-overlay`. The directory is gitignored—changes only persist in the fork repo.

### Keystroke timing calibration

The keystroke overlay timing is controlled by `keystrokeDelayMS` in `ffmpeg.go`:

```go
keystrokeDelayMS  = 500.0   // Delay to sync with terminal rendering
```

**How this was calibrated:**
1. The overlay must appear synchronized with when the terminal responds to the keystroke
2. Initial value (600ms) showed keystrokes appearing ~240ms LATE (after terminal changed)
3. Frame-by-frame GIF analysis (25fps = 40ms/frame) revealed the exact offset
4. Reduced to 500ms achieves perfect sync—keystroke and terminal change on same frame

**To recalibrate if needed:**
```bash
# Extract frames from GIF
ffmpeg -i demo.gif -vsync 0 /tmp/gif-frames/frame_%04d.png

# Compare frames to find when terminal changes vs when keystroke appears
# Adjust keystrokeDelayMS: increase if keystroke appears too early, decrease if too late
```

## wt-switch-picker demo goals (interactive picker)

The wt-switch-picker demo showcases the interactive picker (`wt switch` without args) with **realistic variety in all columns**:

| Column | Demonstration |
|--------|---------------|
| CI | Hollow ○ (branch CI) vs filled ● (PR CI) vs none |
| HEAD± | Large staged diff (+54), small unstaged (+8), none |
| Status | Staged changes (+), unstaged (!), ahead/behind (↕) |
| main↕ | Some branches ahead-only, some ahead-and-behind |
| main…± | Meaningful merge-base diffstats (small to 300+ lines) |

Branch setup (from shared infrastructure):
- **alpha** — Large working tree changes, unpushed commits, PR CI
- **beta** — Staged changes, behind main, branch CI
- **hooks** — Staged+unstaged changes, no remote

## Light/dark theme variants

The docs build generates both light and dark GIF variants in separate directories:
- `docs/light/wt-core.gif` / `docs/dark/wt-core.gif`
- `docs/light/wt-merge.gif` / `docs/dark/wt-merge.gif`
- `docs/light/wt-switch-picker.gif` / `docs/dark/wt-switch-picker.gif`

Social build generates light only (social media doesn't support theme-switching media queries).

Theme definitions are in `docs/demos/shared/themes.py`, matching the CSS variables in `_variables.html`.

## Debugging a demo environment

Use `--shell` to spawn an interactive fish shell with the demo environment:

```bash
./docs/demos/build social --only wt-switch --shell
```

This builds the demo and drops you into a fish shell with `HOME`, `PATH`, starship, and wt shell integration all configured. You're already in the demo repo and ready to test:

```fish
# Now you can manually test:
claude                                    # See what happens on first launch
wt switch --create foo                    # Create a worktree
wt switch --execute claude --create bar   # Test the demo command
```

## Timing guidelines

Demo GIFs should feel natural—not rushed, but not lingering. The goal is to let viewers read and understand each step before moving on.

| Context | Duration | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Simple output (one-liner) | 1.5s | Just enough to scan a short result |
| List/table output | 2–2.5s | Tables need more time to scan visually |
| Multi-line text (config, log) | 3s | Dense text requires reading time |
| Long operations (merge, hooks) | Match actual | Use real duration; don't artificially shorten |
| LLM operations | 4s | Show thinking + generated output |
| Transitions (cd, switch) | 1–1.5s | Brief pause after context change |
| Quick sequences (keystrokes) | 0.1–0.5s | Related actions feel like one gesture |
| Tab completion (shows menu) | 400ms | Pause after Tab when menu appears for viewer to see options |
| Tab completion (cycles selection) | 300ms | Pause after Tab cycles to show selected option |
| Tab completion (auto-completes) | 0 | No pause needed when Tab completes to single result |
| Tab completion (before Enter) | 50ms | Required after final Tab/selection before Enter; lets fish settle |
| Tab cycling → execute | Enter, 50ms, Enter | When Tab cycling with pager open: first Enter accepts, second executes |
| End hold (before exit) | 2–4s | Let final state sink in |
| Pre-enter pause | 1s | For commands where output clears visible area: TUI takeover (`claude`) or heavy output (`wt merge`). |
| Claude UI startup | 6s | Big visual change; wait for UI to render and settle |

**Principles:**

1. **Focus on output, not typing.** TypingSpeed is fast (28ms). Time is for reading results.
2. **Match reality for slow operations.** If `wt merge` takes 8s, sleep 8s. Don't fake speed.
3. **Group related actions.** Multiple keystrokes (↓↓) can be rapid; pause after the group.
4. **End with breathing room.** Viewers need a moment to absorb the final state.
5. **Twitter context.** These are viewed on phones in noisy feeds—slightly longer is better than too fast.
6. **Type what users would type.** If a flag is needed for technical reasons (e.g., `--color=always` for VHS), handle it in the background setup (env var, git config) so the demo shows the natural command. Never show flags users wouldn't normally type.

## Key files in the demo environment

After spawning the shell, these files control Claude Code behavior:

- `$HOME/.claude.json` - Claude Code global config (onboarding flags, marketplace settings)
- `$HOME/.claude/settings.json` - Claude Code settings (statusLine config)
- `$HOME/.config/worktrunk/config.toml` - Worktrunk user config
- `$HOME/w/acme/.config/wt.toml` - Project hooks config

Key fields in `.claude.json` for suppressing notifications:
- `officialMarketplaceAutoInstalled: true` - should suppress marketplace auto-install
- `numStartups: 100` - makes Claude think it's been run many times
- `hasCompletedOnboarding: true` - skips onboarding

## Viewing GIF results

**Do NOT use `open` on the GIF** — that's for the user to do manually.

Inline viewing options:
```bash
# Quick Look (macOS)
qlmanage -p docs/static/assets/docs/light/wt-switch-picker.gif

# iTerm2 inline images
imgcat docs/static/assets/docs/light/wt-switch-picker.gif
```

## Reviewing demo GIFs

After building demos, use a subagent to review for visual errors before publishing.

**Extract frames and review:**
```bash
rm -rf /tmp/frames && mkdir -p /tmp/frames
magick path/to/demo.gif -coalesce /tmp/frames/frame_%04d.png
```

Then spawn a haiku subagent with these instructions:

```
Review this demo GIF for visual errors.

Read frames sampled throughout the recording — every 50th frame covers a
~2000 frame GIF in ~40 images. Use the Read tool on:
/tmp/frames/frame_0050.png, frame_0100.png, frame_0150.png, ... etc.

Look for:
1. SPLIT COMMANDS: Text split across panes (e.g., "gi" in one pane, "t diff" in another)
2. ERRORS/WARNINGS: Shell errors like "Unknown command", red error text, warning messages
3. WRONG LOCATION: Commands or output appearing in unexpected pane/tab
4. VISUAL GLITCHES: Partial characters, cursor artifacts, broken layouts

Report each issue with:
- Frame number(s)
- Description
- Affected text

If a frame shows an error like "Unknown command: t", examine nearby frames
(±5) to understand the cause — likely a timing bug where a command was split.
```

## Cleaning up stale demo processes

**NEVER run `pkill -f zellij`** — this kills the user's own Zellij session, not just demo processes.

If stale Zellij processes from previous demo runs are causing issues, either:
- Let them die on their own (they'll timeout)
- Target only demo processes: `pkill -f "zellij.*wt-demos"`
- Remove the demo directory and rebuild: `rm -rf /private/tmp/wt-demos`
