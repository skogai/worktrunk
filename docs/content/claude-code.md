Worktrunk ships a plugin for each supported agent CLI. What a plugin provides depends on the hooks that CLI exposes:

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Gemini CLI |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Configuration skill | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| Activity tracking (🤖/💬 in `wt list`) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Worktree isolation | ✓ |  |  |  |
| `/wt-switch-create` command | ✓ |  |  |  |

The configuration skill is documentation the agent reads to help set up LLM commits, hooks, and troubleshooting. Activity tracking shows which worktrees have running sessions. Worktree isolation needs worktree-lifecycle hooks and `/wt-switch-create` needs session working-directory switching — both Claude Code-only, so Codex, OpenCode, and Gemini users invoke `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` directly. Codex tracks activity through its own `Stop` and `SessionEnd` hooks.

## Installation

### Claude Code

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins claude install") }}

Manual equivalent:

{{ terminal(cmd="claude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk|||claude plugin install worktrunk@worktrunk") }}

### Codex

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins codex install") }}

This configures the Worktrunk marketplace in Codex. Then run `/plugins` in Codex and install Worktrunk from the marketplace. Manual equivalent:

{{ terminal(cmd="codex plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk") }}

To remove the marketplace entry, run `wt config plugins codex uninstall`. Already-installed plugins are left unchanged.

### OpenCode

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins opencode install") }}

This writes the activity-tracking plugin to OpenCode's global plugins directory, `~/.config/opencode/plugins/worktrunk.ts` (honoring `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). `wt config plugins opencode uninstall` removes it.

### Gemini CLI

{{ terminal(cmd="gemini extensions install https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk") }}

Gemini loads the extension natively from the repository, so there is no `wt` wrapper. `gemini extensions uninstall worktrunk` removes it.

## Configuration skill

With the `/worktrunk` skill, the agent can help with:

- Setting up LLM-generated commit messages
- Adding project hooks (pre-start, pre-merge, pre-commit)
- Configuring worktree path templates
- Fixing shell integration issues

Claude Code is designed to load the skill automatically when it detects worktrunk-related questions.

## Activity tracking

The Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Gemini plugins track agent sessions with status markers in `wt list`:

- 🤖 — agent is working
- 💬 — agent is waiting or idle

All four plugins clear the marker when a session ends. A stale marker can remain if the agent process is killed before its session-end hook runs. In every case, `wt config state marker clear` removes a marker manually.

### Manual status markers

Set status markers manually for any workflow:

{% terminal() %}
<span class="cmd">wt config state marker set "🚧"                   # Current branch</span>
<span class="cmd">wt config state marker set "✅" --branch feature  # Specific branch</span>
<span class="cmd">git config worktrunk.state.feature.marker '{"marker":"💬","set_at":0}'  # Direct</span>
{% end %}

### Agent CLIs without a plugin

Activity tracking is not plugin-specific. The plugins above only call `wt` on their host's session events, and the marker itself is plain git config — so any CLI that can run a command on session lifecycle events drives the same 🤖/💬 markers with no worktrunk plugin:

| Host event | Command |
|---|---|
| Session starts, or the agent resumes work | `wt config state marker set "🤖"` |
| Agent finishes a turn and waits for input | `wt config state marker set "💬"` |
| Session ends | `wt config state marker clear` |

Three things to get right:

- **Run the command inside the worktree.** Each one resolves the branch from its working directory, so a hook that runs elsewhere marks the wrong branch, and one that runs outside a repository fails. Where the host pins the working directory elsewhere, pass the global `-C <worktree>`, which moves both the repository lookup and the branch resolution; `--branch <branch>` names the branch but still needs the working directory to be inside the repository.
- **Don't let a failed marker call fail the session.** Both `set` and `clear` exit non-zero outside a repository, and hosts differ on what a non-zero hook does. Append `|| true` (or the host's equivalent) to every call unless you want that surfaced.
- **Clear on exit.** A marker set on session start persists until something clears it, so pair every set with a clear on the host's session-end event — and expect the same stale marker as above if the process is killed first.

## Worktree isolation (Claude Code only)

Claude Code agents can run in isolated worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`). By default, Claude Code creates these with `git worktree add`. The plugin's `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hooks route this through `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` instead, so worktrees created by agents get worktrunk's naming conventions, hooks, and lifecycle management.

## `/wt-switch-create` command (Claude Code only)

`/wt-switch-create [<branch>] [<repo>] [-- <task>]` starts a task in a fresh worktree without leaving the session: it creates the worktree, switches into it, and runs the task (all arguments optional). The worktree shows up in `wt list`; merge or remove it with `wt merge` / `wt remove`.

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

`wt list statusline --format=claude-code` outputs a single-line status for the Claude Code statusline. Claude Code runs it in the background, which is what makes the occasional 1–2 second CI fetch invisible.

<code>~/w/myproject.feature-auth  !🤖  @<span style='color:#0a0'>+42</span> <span style='color:#a00'>-8</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>↑3</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>⇡1</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>#3035</span>  Opus  🌔 65%  <span style='color:#a70'>1.4×(10am–3pm)</span></code>

Worktree state comes from the same cells [`wt list`](@/list.md) renders; Claude Code's stdin JSON adds the model, the `🌔 65%` context gauge, and the rate-limit pace notice. [`wt list statusline`](@/list.md#wt-list-statusline) documents every segment, how the links behave, and the JSON fields behind them.

    "command": "wt list statusline --format=claude-code"
  }
}
