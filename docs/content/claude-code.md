Worktrunk ships a plugin for each supported agent CLI. What a plugin provides depends on the hooks that CLI exposes:

| Capability | Claude Code | Codex | OpenCode | Gemini CLI |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Configuration skill | ✓ | ✓ |  | ✓ |
| Activity tracking (🤖/💬 in `wt list`) | ✓ |  | ✓ | ✓ |
| Worktree isolation | ✓ |  |  |  |
| `/wt-switch-create` command | ✓ |  |  |  |

The configuration skill is documentation the agent reads to help set up LLM commits, hooks, and troubleshooting. Activity tracking shows which worktrees have running sessions. Worktree isolation needs worktree-lifecycle hooks and `/wt-switch-create` needs session working-directory switching — both Claude Code-only, so Codex, OpenCode, and Gemini users invoke `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` directly. Codex omits activity tracking because its hooks have no turn-end event, so a 🤖 marker could never clear back to 💬.

## Installation

### Claude Code

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins claude install") }}

Manual equivalent:

{{ terminal(cmd="claude plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk|||claude plugin install worktrunk@worktrunk") }}

### Codex

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins codex install") }}

This configures the Worktrunk marketplace in Codex. Then run `/plugins` in Codex and install Worktrunk from the marketplace. Manual equivalent:

{{ terminal(cmd="codex plugin marketplace add max-sixty/worktrunk") }}

To remove the marketplace entry, run `wt config plugins codex uninstall`. Already-installed plugins are left unchanged.

### OpenCode

{{ terminal(cmd="wt config plugins opencode install") }}

This writes the activity-tracking plugin to OpenCode's global plugins directory, `~/.config/opencode/plugins/worktrunk.ts` (honoring `$OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). `wt config plugins opencode uninstall` removes it.

### Gemini CLI

{{ terminal(cmd="gemini extensions install https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk") }}

Gemini loads the extension natively from the repository, so there is no `wt` wrapper. `gemini extensions uninstall worktrunk` removes it.

## Configuration skill

With the `/worktrunk` skill, the agent can help with:

- Setting up LLM-generated commit messages
- Adding project hooks (pre-start, pre-merge, pre-commit)
- Configuring worktree path templates
- Fixing shell integration issues

Claude Code is designed to load the skill automatically when it detects worktrunk-related questions.

## Activity tracking

The Claude Code, OpenCode, and Gemini plugins track agent sessions with status markers in `wt list`:

- 🤖 — agent is working
- 💬 — agent is waiting or idle

The plugin clears the marker when a session ends. A stale marker can remain if the agent process is killed before its session-end hook runs; `wt config state marker clear` removes a marker manually.

### Manual status markers

Set status markers manually for any workflow:

{% terminal() %}
<span class="cmd">wt config state marker set "🚧"                   # Current branch</span>
<span class="cmd">wt config state marker set "✅" --branch feature  # Specific branch</span>
<span class="cmd">git config worktrunk.state.feature.marker '{"marker":"💬","set_at":0}'  # Direct</span>
{% end %}

## Worktree isolation (Claude Code only)

Claude Code agents can run in isolated worktrees (`isolation: "worktree"`). By default, Claude Code creates these with `git worktree add`. The plugin's `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hooks route this through `wt switch --create` and `wt remove` instead, so worktrees created by agents get worktrunk's naming conventions, hooks, and lifecycle management.

## `/wt-switch-create` command (Claude Code only)

`/wt-switch-create [<branch>] [<repo>] [-- <task>]` starts a task in a fresh worktree without leaving the session: it creates the worktree, switches into it, and runs the task (all arguments optional). The worktree persists like any other; merge or remove it with `wt merge` / `wt remove`.

## Statusline (Claude Code only)

`wt list statusline --format=claude-code` outputs a single-line status for the Claude Code statusline. When the CI status cache is stale, this fetches from the network — typically 1–2 seconds — making it suitable for async statuslines but too slow for synchronous shell prompts. If a faster version would be helpful, please [open an issue](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues).

<code>~/w/myproject.feature-auth  !🤖  @<span style='color:#0a0'>+42</span> <span style='color:#a00'>-8</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>↑3</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>⇡1</span>  <span style='color:#0a0'>#3035</span>  Opus  🌔 65%  <span style='color:#a70'>1.4×(10am–3pm)</span></code>

When Claude Code provides context window usage via stdin JSON, a moon phase gauge appears (🌕→🌑 as context fills). A `<n>×(<window>)` segment appears when Claude's 5-hour or weekly rate limit is on track to be hit before reset — `1.4×(10am–3pm)` reads as 1.4× the pace that would exactly fill that window. Its colour deepens with severity — dim, then dim-yellow, then yellow — as more of the window would be spent locked out at the cap, so a fast pace that would only tip over near the reset stays dim. Above 90% used it shows usage instead of pace — `93%(10am–3pm)` — near the cap, how much is left matters more than how fast it's going.
