#![cfg(feature = "shell-integration-tests")]
//! TUI snapshot tests for `wt switch` interactive picker
//!
//! These tests use PTY execution combined with vt100 terminal emulation to capture
//! what the user actually sees on screen, enabling meaningful snapshot testing of
//! the skim-based TUI interface. They run on every platform — `portable_pty` uses a
//! ConPTY on Windows (see `tests/common/pty.rs`), and capturing the vt100-emulated
//! grid (not raw escape sequences) keeps the snapshots backend-agnostic.
//!
//! ## Capture-Before-Abort Pattern
//!
//! Abort tests snapshot the screen BEFORE sending Escape, not after. Skim's teardown
//! is asynchronous — sending Escape races with rendering, producing non-deterministic
//! output (variable border painting, incomplete rows). By capturing the stable pre-abort
//! state, we eliminate this entire class of flakiness. After capture, Escape is sent and
//! only the exit code is checked.
//!
//! ## Timing Strategy
//!
//! Instead of fixed delays (which are either too short on slow CI or wastefully
//! long on fast machines), we poll for screen stabilization:
//!
//! - **Long timeouts** (30s) ensure reliability on slow CI
//! - **Fast polling** (10ms) means tests complete quickly when things work
//! - **Content-based readiness** detects when skim has rendered ("> " prompt)
//! - **Stabilization detection** waits for screen to stop changing
//! - **Content expectations** wait for async preview content to load (e.g., "diff --git")
