//! Global output context with file-based directive passing
//!
//! Shell integration directives (cd, exec) travel from wt to the parent shell
//! through files named by environment variables. This module chooses the right
//! file for each directive and escalates a warning when a trusted directive is
//! refused. Regular output still uses `eprintln!`/`println!` directly (from
//! `worktrunk::styling` for color support).
//!
//! # Protocol
//!
//! Shell integration uses two separate files with different trust levels:
//!
//! - `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_CD_FILE` holds a single raw path. The wrapper runs
//!   `cd -- "$(< file)"` after wt exits. There is no shell parsing, no
//!   escaping, and no injection surface, so the env var is safe to pass
//!   through to alias/hook shell bodies — a body that appends to it can at
//!   worst redirect `cd`.
//!
//! - `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_EXEC_FILE` holds arbitrary shell that the wrapper
//!   sources after the `cd`. This is how `wt switch --execute <cmd>` runs its
//!   payload in the user's interactive shell, inheriting functions and env.
//!   Because the contents are sourced verbatim, wt scrubs this env var from
//!   alias and foreground-hook child processes so a hook body cannot inject
//!   shell into the parent session.
//!
//! # Conservative scrub
//!
//! Because the EXEC env var is scrubbed from alias/hook child environments, a
//! nested `wt` invocation inside an alias body (e.g. `wt step my-alias` where
//! the alias runs `wt switch main --execute claude`) sees no EXEC file and
//! refuses to run the `--execute` payload, emitting a warning and a link to
//! <https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk/issues/2101> so users can report
//! whether to relax the restriction.
//!
//! # Legacy compat
//!
//! Users who upgrade wt without restarting their shell still run the previous
//! release's shell wrapper, which only sets `WORKTRUNK_DIRECTIVE_FILE`. When
//! only that variable is set, wt falls back to the pre-split protocol (shell
//! commands written to the single file) silently. For bash, zsh, fish, and
//! PowerShell a shell restart picks up the new wrapper automatically; nushell
//! is the only shell where users have to rerun `wt config shell install`
//! because its wrapper is a static file. Remove the legacy path in the next
//! breaking release.
