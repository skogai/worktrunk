//! Identify and reap orphaned `git fsmonitor--daemon` processes.
//!
//! Git's builtin fsmonitor (`core.fsmonitor=true`) starts one
//! `git fsmonitor--daemon` per worktree. Each daemon owns a Unix domain socket
//! at `<git-dir-for-worktree>/fsmonitor--daemon.ipc`. The daemon is a stateless
//! filesystem-watch cache: if its worktree is gone, git will never talk to it
//! or respawn it, and it will live until the machine reboots. Daemons leak
//! whenever a worktree is destroyed by a path that bypasses `wt remove`'s
//! `git fsmonitor--daemon stop` call — plain `git worktree remove`, manual
//! `rm -rf`, or a crashed `wt`.
//!
//! This module is the defense-in-depth sweep: it finds daemons that are
//! *provably* orphaned and terminates them. It rides the existing repo-wide
//! internal cleanup op (the same opportunistic cadence as the stale-trash
//! sweep), runs after primary user output, and is strictly best-effort —
//! every failure path logs at debug level and continues. It never fails or
//! materially slows the operation it rides on.
//!
//! # Data-safety contract
//!
//! A daemon is reaped only when it is provably not serving any live worktree.
//! Two classes qualify, both identified through the IPC socket alone (never by
//! matching process names broadly):
//!
//! 1. **Unresolvable socket** — `lsof` reports the socket as the bare name
//!    `fsmonitor--daemon.ipc` with no directory. That happens only when the
//!    socket's containing directory (the worktree's git-dir) no longer exists.
//!    A live worktree's git-dir always exists, so a bare-name socket cannot
//!    belong to any live worktree of any repo. Reaped unconditionally — this
//!    is the class behind large machine-wide accumulations.
//! 2. **Resolved, but not a live worktree of this repo** — the socket resolves
//!    to `<git-dir>/fsmonitor--daemon.ipc` where `<git-dir>` is under this
//!    repo's git-common-dir but is not the git-dir of any live (non-prunable,
//!    on-disk) worktree. This is a worktree that was removed while its git
//!    metadata lingered (e.g. a not-yet-pruned `prunable` entry). Class 2
//!    requires a trustworthy live-worktree set: if `git worktree list` fails,
//!    the set is unknowable and class 2 is skipped entirely, so a transient
//!    git failure can never escalate to reaping a live worktree's daemon.
//!    Only class 1, which holds regardless of the live set, survives that.
//!
//! A daemon whose socket resolves to a *live* worktree's git-dir is NEVER
//! reaped, even if it appears wedged. Killing a live worktree's daemon
//! implicitly is out of scope by design (no implicit destructive side
//! effects); the residual wedged-but-live case is handled by the user via the
//! documented manual workaround.
//!
//! # Signal discipline
//!
//! Orphans get `SIGTERM`, then a single bounded poll budget
//! (`REAP_KILL_DEADLINE`) for them to exit, then `SIGKILL` for any
//! survivor. The wait is always bounded — never indefinite.
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! Unix only. The daemon uses a named pipe on Windows (not a socket), and
//! `lsof` is not the discovery tool there; the reap is a no-op on Windows
//! rather than guessing. The public entry point compiles on all platforms so
//! callers need no `cfg`; the Unix-specific machinery is gated internally.
