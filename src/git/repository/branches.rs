//! Branch-related operations for Repository.
//!
//! For single-branch operations, see [`super::Branch`].
//! This module contains multi-branch operations (listing, filtering, etc.).
//!
//! # Branch inventory
//!
//! Every multi-branch operation in this file reads from one of two
//! inventories — [`Repository::local_branches`] and
//! [`Repository::remote_branches`]. Each is populated by a single
//! `git for-each-ref` scan that's cached on `RepoCache` for the lifetime of
//! this `Repository` instance (shared across clones via `Arc`):
//!
//! - `refs/heads/` scan fetches name, SHA, committer timestamp, and upstream
//!   tracking info — enough to satisfy every local-branch accessor (name
//!   listing, SHA priming, upstream resolution, completion ordering). The
//!   inventory also carries a name → index map so single-branch lookups
//!   (e.g. [`super::Branch::upstream`]) are O(1) without a separate scan.
//! - `refs/remotes/` scan fetches the same fields for remote-tracking refs.
//!
//! Repeated accessors within a single command share the cached data. This
//! consolidation replaces what used to be five overlapping `for-each-ref`
//! calls (one per accessor) with at most two.
//!
//! Both scans are idempotent: their results depend only on the repository's
//! ref state at the moment of the first call. Branches created mid-command
//! by wt itself (e.g., after `git worktree add -b ...`) will not appear —
//! but no caller needs to observe its own mutations through these accessors.
