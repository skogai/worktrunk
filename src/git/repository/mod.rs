//! Repository - git repository operations.
//!
//! This module provides the [`Repository`] type for interacting with git repositories,
//! [`WorkingTree`] for worktree-specific operations, and [`Branch`] for branch-specific
//! operations.
//!
//! # Module organization
//!
//! - `mod.rs` - Core types and construction
//! - `working_tree.rs` - WorkingTree struct and worktree-specific operations
//! - `branch.rs` - Branch struct and single-branch operations (exists, upstream, remotes)
//! - `branches.rs` - Multi-branch operations (listing, filtering, completions)
//! - `worktrees.rs` - Worktree management (list, resolve, remove)
//! - `remotes.rs` - Remote and URL operations
//! - `diff.rs` - Diff, history, and commit operations
//! - `config.rs` - Git config, hints, markers, and default branch detection
//! - `integration.rs` - Integration detection (same commit, ancestor, trees match)
//!
//! # Caching
//!
//! Most repository data — remote URLs, config, default branch, merge-bases — is stable
//! for the duration of a single CLI command. [`RepoCache`] exploits this by caching
//! read-only values so repeated queries hit memory instead of spawning git processes.
//!
//! **Two layers, two scopes.** Cached state lives in either of:
//! - `RepoCache` — per-`Repository::at()` instance. Most repo-wide values
//!   (config, branches, worktree inventory) live here.
//! - Process-wide `LazyLock<DashMap>` statics — `GIT_COMMON_DIR_CACHE`,
//!   `WORKTREE_ROOTS`, `GIT_DIRS`, `CURRENT_BRANCHES`. The git-discovery
//!   data they hold is keyed by canonicalized filesystem path, so two
//!   `Repository` instances pointed at the same path see the same answer.
//!   This lets [`Repository::prewarm`] populate the maps once at the start
//!   of `main` and have every later `Repository::current()` (each builds a
//!   fresh `RepoCache`) reuse the result.
//!
//! **Lifetime.** Neither layer is ever invalidated. `RepoCache` lives as
//! long as the `Repository` it's attached to (typically the command).
//! Process-wide statics live for the process. For the CLI that's the same
//! thing — one command per process — but tests run many commands in one
//! process, so they may observe state from prior test cases (in practice
//! safe: tests use unique tempdir paths, and the maps are filesystem-keyed).
//!
//! **Sharing.** `Repository` holds an `Arc<RepoCache>`, so cloning a `Repository`
//! (e.g., to pass into parallel worktree operations in `wt list`) shares the same
//! cache. Callers that need a *separate* cache must call `Repository::at()` again
//! — but the process-wide maps are still shared in either case.
//!
//! **What is NOT cached.** Values that change during command execution are intentionally
//! excluded:
//! - `WorkingTree::is_dirty()` — changes as we stage and commit
//! - `WorkingTree::head_sha()` — HEAD moves on commit, rebase, or merge; a stale SHA
//!   would surface in template variables (`{{ commit }}`) for hooks that fire after the move
//!
//! [`Repository::list_worktrees`] is cached despite mutating commands adding or
//! removing worktrees. The cache is safe because no caller reads the list
//! through the same `Repository` after its own mutation — mutating paths
//! either read once up front and thread the slice through, or rebuild a
//! fresh `Repository::at(...)` before any post-mutation probe. This mirrors
//! the invariant the branch inventories already rely on.
//!
//! **Access patterns.** See the [`RepoCache`] doc comment for the two storage patterns
//! (repo-wide `OnceCell` vs per-key `DashMap`) and their infallible/fallible variants.
//!
//! **Invariants:**
//! - A cached value, once written, is never updated within the same command.
//! - All cache access is lock-free at the call site — `OnceCell` and `DashMap` handle
//!   synchronization internally.
//! - Code that mutates repository state (committing, creating worktrees) must not read
//!   its own mutations through the cache. Use direct git commands for post-mutation
//!   state.
//!
//! **Other process-level singletons.** Outside `RepoCache` and the
//! git-discovery caches above, several modules use `OnceLock`/`LazyLock` for
//! process-global singletons that are *lazy initialization, not caches* —
//! the container is initialized once and never replaced, with no underlying
//! external state that could go stale:
//! - Resource limiters: `CMD_SEMAPHORE` (shell_exec), `HEAVY_OPS_SEMAPHORE` (git),
//!   `LLM_SEMAPHORE` (summary), `COPY_POOL` (copy)
//! - Global state: `OUTPUT_STATE` (output), `TRACE` and `OUTPUT` (log_files), `COMMAND_LOG`
//! - Config: `CONFIG_PATH` (config/user/path), `SHELL_CONFIG`, `GIT_ENV_OVERRIDES` (shell_exec)
//!
//! The picker also maintains a `PreviewCache` (`Arc<DashMap>` in `commands/picker/items.rs`)
//! for rendered preview output, scoped to a single picker session.
