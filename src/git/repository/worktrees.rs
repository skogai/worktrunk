    ///   path" more than a guess. Without this, a name shadows a branch:
    ///   `wt remove docs` means the branch even when `docs/` sits beside it.
    /// - No worktree of this repository is registered there, which is half of
    ///   what the error asserts. A detached worktree is reachable by its path
    ///   and by nothing else, so without this the message contradicts the
    ///   `wt list` its hint points at. The check is here rather than left to
    ///   callers because a caller cannot be relied on to have made it:
    ///   `resolve_worktree` skips the path lookup whenever a shortcut rewrote
    ///   the argument, so `-` expanding to a worktree's path arrives having
    ///   matched nothing.
    /// - Nothing there claims to be a git directory, which is the other half:
    ///   `list_worktrees` covers only *this* repository, and worktrunk gathers
    ///   every repo and every worktree into one parent, so a sibling's live
    ///   checkout is one `../` away from any command. Calling one "not a
