//! TTY spinners for long-running work.
//!
//! Two spinner types share one set of render primitives (spinner frames, cursor
//! control, TTY gating, clear-on-drop): [`Progress`] shows file/byte counters
//! for file-walk operations; [`Watchdog`] shows an elapsed-time "still waiting"
//! line for a slow blocking subprocess (e.g. the `commit.generation` LLM) so a
//! long or hung command isn't silent.
//!
//! ## `Progress`
//!
//! Shows a single-line stderr spinner (`⠋ Copying 1,234 files · 312 MiB`,
//! `⠋ Removing 7,272 files · 64.5 MiB`) that updates in place while the work
//! runs. Workers bump atomic counters via [`Progress::record`]; a background
//! thread renders at ~10Hz using crossterm cursor control.
//!
//! `Progress` is the single owner of operation counts: every state (spinner
//! enabled, disabled, and the no-`cli` stub) accumulates files/bytes, and
//! [`Progress::totals`] reads the running totals from `&self` mid-operation.
//! Callers report from `totals()` rather than keeping their own counters.
//! Counts accumulate for the lifetime of the reporter, so each counted
//! operation (or batch reported as one) gets its own `Progress`.
//!
//! `start` is named deliberately (not `new`) because it spawns a ticker thread
//! as a side effect — `Default`-style semantics would be misleading. The verb
//! (`"Copying"`, `"Removing"`) is fixed for the lifetime of the spinner.
//!
//! The progress line is cleared on [`Progress::finish`] or on drop, so the
//! caller can print a summary message immediately afterward without overlap.
//!
//! The spinner machinery (crossterm, the ticker thread, the render loop) is
//! gated on the `cli` feature. Without `cli`, [`Progress`] keeps the counters
//! but never renders. Pure formatting helpers ([`format_bytes`],
//! [`format_stats_paren`]) are always available since callers in both modes
//! want them.
