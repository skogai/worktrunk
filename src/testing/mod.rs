//! Shared test fixtures for worktrunk unit and integration tests.
//!
//! This module is `#[doc(hidden)] pub` so both library (`src/`) and binary
//! (`src/commands/`) unit tests, as well as integration tests (`tests/`), can
//! use it. Integration tests import via `worktrunk::testing::TestRepo`.
//!
//! ## TestRepo
//!
//! The `TestRepo` struct creates isolated git repositories in temporary directories
//! with deterministic timestamps and configuration. Each test gets a fresh repo
//! that is automatically cleaned up when the test ends.
//!
//! ## Constructors
//!
//! - [`TestRepo::new()`] — lightweight: `git init` + identity. For unit tests.
//! - [`TestRepo::with_initial_commit()`] — lightweight + one commit.
//! - [`TestRepo::bare()`] — bare repository (`git init --bare`). No working tree.
//! - [`TestRepo::at(path)`](TestRepo::at) — repo at a caller-specified path.
//!   For tests needing multiple repos in a shared directory.
//! - [`TestRepo::bare_at(path)`](TestRepo::bare_at) — bare repo at a
//!   caller-specified path (e.g. the `project/.git` clone layout).
//! - [`TestRepo::standard()`] — copies pre-built fixture with remote + worktrees.
//!   For integration tests (used by the `repo()` rstest fixture).
//! - [`TestRepo::standard_main_only()`] — copies the same pinned main history and
//!   remote without linked worktrees. For tests that shape their own topology.
//! - [`TestRepo::empty()`] — `git init` with no commits, no branches.
//!
//! ## Environment Isolation
//!
//! No `git` the suite runs reads the developer's `~/.gitconfig`. The
//! guarantee is `shell_exec::HERMETIC_TEST_GIT_ENV` — the deny pair pointing
//! `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL` and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` at a path that does not exist,
//! plus `user.useConfigOnly` through `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` so a git with no
//! identity fails rather than guessing one from the host — applied to every
//! child at its spawn site. For the git that *production* code spawns while a
//! test drives it in-process, the spawn site is `Cmd`, and the harness has no
//! per-command hook there; instead the fixture constructors latch
//! `shell_exec::enable_hermetic_test_env`, and `Cmd` applies the floor to
//! every child while the latch is set. (A test cannot set its own process
//! environment instead — under `cargo test` tests are parallel threads, and
//! `std::env::set_var` beside them is the race that makes it `unsafe`; the
//! atomic latch is sound from any thread.)
//!
//! The rest applies the same floor at the spawn sites the harness does own:
//!
//! - [`git_test_env`] adds the test identity, pinned dates, and locale per
//!   command, which the floor leaves to the per-command layers.
//! - [`isolate_subprocess_env`] scrubs the host's `GIT_*` from `wt` children
//!   and re-applies the floor explicitly, so a subprocess denies host config
//!   just as this process does.
//!
//! On top of that isolation the helpers pin commit timestamps, locale, and
//! terminal width, all per command — no test mutates process-global state.
