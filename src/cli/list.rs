A stale CI status cache makes it reach the network for a second or two, so it fits a statusline the host renders in the background — Claude Code's, a `tmux` status bar — better than a prompt the shell blocks on.

## Output formats

- `table` (default): `branch  status  HEAD±  main↕  main…±  Remote⇅  CI  URL`
- `json`: A one-entry array in the `wt list --format=json` schema
- `claude-code`: the `table` cells, preceded by `dir` and followed by `model  context  pace`

A cell with nothing to show is left out rather than blanked, so most lines are shorter than that; `claude-code` also drops `branch` where `dir` already ends in `.<branch>`. A line that still overruns the terminal drops whole cells, least important first, starting with the dev server URL.

The CI reference links to its PR/MR, and a dev server URL carrying a port shows as `:3000` linking to the URL in full, dim until something answers on that port. Both are underlined, which is what marks them as clickable. They are OSC 8 links, and a terminal that doesn't support those discards the escape, leaving the underlined text unclickable.

## Claude Code mode

`--format=claude-code` reads JSON context from stdin (`.workspace.current_dir` is required; the rest are optional):

- `.workspace.current_dir` — working directory
- `.model.display_name` — model name
- `.context_window.used_percentage` — context usage (0–100), rendered as `🌔 65%`, the moon waning 🌕→🌑 as context fills
- `.rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.used_percentage` — rate-limit window usage (0–100)
- `.rate_limits.{five_hour,seven_day}.resets_at` — window reset time (Unix epoch seconds)

The pace segment appears only when usage is likely to hit a rate limit before its window resets, and shows the higher-risk window: `2.9×(Tue–Tue 5pm)` reads as 2.9× the pace that would exactly fill that window. Above 90% used it shows usage instead of pace — `93%(Tue–Tue 5pm)` — near the cap, how much is left matters more than how fast it's going. "Likely" is a Bayesian forecast; early-window bursts don't trigger it. Its colour deepens with severity — dim, then dim-yellow, then yellow — as the forecast lockout (how much of the window would be spent capped) grows, so a fast pace that would only tip over near the reset stays dim rather than alarming. With `-vv`, each window's inputs and projection are logged to `.git/wt/logs/trace.log`.

[Claude Code statusline setup](@/claude-code.md#statusline-claude-code-only) has the `~/.claude/settings.json` entry that feeds this mode.
