//! Shared LLM summary generation for branches.
//!
//! Generates branch summaries using the configured LLM command, with caching
//! in `.git/wt/cache/summary/{sanitized_branch}/{diff_hash}.json`. The
//! combined diff (branch diff + working tree diff) is hashed with SHA-256
//! and the hex-truncated digest becomes the filename — so a cache hit is
//! just "does the file exist?" rather than parsing JSON to compare a field.
//!
//! Used by both `wt list --full` (Summary column) and `wt switch` (preview tab).
//!
//! # Layout and invalidation
//!
//! Content-addressed filename: a successful write to `{hash}.json` means that
//! file holds the summary for that exact diff. No TTL, no separate staleness
//! check — see [`worktrunk::cache`] for the shared torn-write semantics.
//!
//! # Prune on write
//!
//! After a successful write, the branch directory is trimmed to one entry
//! via [`cache::sweep_lru`] with a cap of 1 — same mechanism `sha_cache`
//! uses, just at a per-branch directory with a size of one. The newest-mtime
//! file (the one we just wrote) survives; older hashes are dead weight.
//!
//! Best-effort: two concurrent writers for the same branch can briefly
//! leave two entries, and a sweep racing a just-written sibling can delete
//! it. Worst case is one extra LLM call on the next invocation.
