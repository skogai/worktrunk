//! Hook config loading, step preparation, and execution.
//!
//! See [`super::hook_announcement`] for the announcement format / grammar that
//! the background path emits before spawning pipelines.
//!
//! # Which `.config/wt.toml` a hook reads
//!
//! Every hook resolves its commands from the **invoking** worktree's
//! `.config/wt.toml` — the worktree `wt` ran in, read from its working tree.
//! That holds regardless of which worktree the hook is *about*: `post-merge`
//! runs in the merge target and `post-start` in the newly created worktree,
//! but both select their commands from the invoking worktree's config — the
//! same file `wt config show` reads.
//!
//! Two execution models split on whether a state mutation separates the
//! approval gate from execution.
//!
//! **Plan-backed (the TOCTOU-covered set):** `pre-merge`, `post-merge`,
//! `pre-remove`, `post-remove`, `post-switch`, `pre-start`, `post-start`. A
//! merge, rebase, removal, or `git worktree add` runs between the gate and
//! these hooks; a rebase can even rewrite the invoking worktree's own
//! `.config/wt.toml`, so a second config read could select a command the user
//! never approved. Each command gate calls `load_project_config()` on the
//! invoking worktree once, selects the commands, and freezes them into a
//! [`super::hook_plan::ApprovedHookPlan`]; the executor renders and runs only
//! that frozen value via [`super::hook_plan::execute_planned_hook`] /
//! [`super::hook_plan::register_planned`], holding no `ProjectConfig` to
//! re-derive from. See the [`super::hook_plan`] module spec.
//!
//! | Plan-backed hook | Runs in (the anchor) | Gate |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `pre-merge`, `pre-remove`, `post-remove` | the feature/removed worktree | `merge::approve_merge_plan`, `remove::handle_remove_command`'s `approve_remove`, `step::prune::approve_prune_hooks` |
//! | `post-merge`, `post-switch` (after a removal) | the merge/removal destination | the same gates |
//! | `pre-start`, `post-start`, `post-switch` (on switch) | the new/destination worktree | `worktree::switch::approve_switch_hooks` |
//!
//! "Runs in" is the *anchor* — the executor's plan lookup key and render root,
//! not a config source. A `pre-start`'s new worktree need not exist when the
//! gate runs; the config came from the invoking worktree regardless.
//!
//! **Invocation-resolved (no gate→exec mutation):** `pre-commit`,
//! `post-commit`, `pre-switch`, `wt hook <type>`, aliases. They resolve config
//! from `ctx.repo.load_project_config()` at invocation via [`execute_hook`] /
//! [`HookAnnouncer::register`]. Two facts make that re-read safe, and a new
//! call site must preserve **both**: (1) nothing between the gate and the
//! executor mutates the worktree `.config/wt.toml`; (2) the executor reads
//! through the **same `Repository` instance** the gate used —
//! `load_project_config` reads the working-tree file and memoizes it in a
//! never-invalidated `OnceCell` (`RepoCache::project_config`), so the
//! executor's call is a cache hit returning the gate's exact bytes. A
//! refactor that runs an uncovered executor through a fresh `Repository::at()`
//! (empty cache) breaks (2) and silently reintroduces the TOCTOU even if (1)
//! still holds — there is no compile-time guard here, unlike the plan-backed
//! set. (Aliases get the property structurally instead: the body is frozen
//! into `AliasEntry` before the gate, like `ApprovedHookPlan`.)
//!
//! `ctx.repo` is the invoking worktree — except `wt step commit --branch <b>`
//! and `wt -C <path>` re-root the whole command (the commit, its hooks, and
//! `ctx.repo` are all `<b>`), so "the invoking worktree" follows them.
//!
//! A present-but-malformed config aborts the operation rather than silently
//! running something else. `WORKTRUNK_PROJECT_CONFIG_PATH` overrides the path
//! (test isolation); user config (`~/.config/worktrunk/config.toml`) is global
//! and unaffected.

///
/// In a merged user+project alias body, the user's steps still get the
/// relaxation — the decision is per-step, so the project side scrubbing
/// doesn't bleed back into the user steps.
