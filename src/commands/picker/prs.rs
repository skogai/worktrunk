//! Open PR/MR picker source (`wt switch --prs`).
//!
//! Widens the interactive picker with the repository's open pull requests
//! (GitHub) or merge requests (GitLab). Each row's `output()` is the
//! `pr:{N}` / `mr:{N}` shortcut, so selection routes through the exact same
//! [`SwitchPipeline`](super::super::worktree::SwitchPipeline) as
//! `wt switch pr:{N}` — fetch the ref, switch to its branch. No new switch
//! logic: the shortcut parsing in `commands::worktree::switch` already
//! resolves both same-repo and fork PRs/MRs.
//!
//! # Streaming
//!
//! The list is a single forge call (`gh pr list` / `glab mr list`) run on a
//! dedicated thread that holds a clone of skim's item channel. The picker
//! frame paints instantly from local worktree data; PR rows appear when the
//! call returns (~1s). The thread's sender drop is part of the picker's
//! EOF contract — skim's reader sees end-of-stream only once every sender
//! drops — see [`super::handle_picker`].
//!
//! # Alignment
//!
//! PR rows render on the same column grid as the worktree rows: a dim `#`
//! gutter sigil (see [`PR_GUTTER_SIGIL`]), the head branch in the Branch
//! column, and the number — in the CI column when the layout has one, else
//! just after the branch so it never hides. The PR title and author have no
//! worktree-column equivalent, so they stay off the row (in the `pr` preview
//! tab) rather than misaligning the grid — see [`render_grid_row`]. The geometry
//! ([`ColumnGrid`]) is computed by the collect thread at skeleton time and
//! handed over through a [`GridSlot`]; the skeleton (~50ms) beats the forge
//! call (~1s), so the wait is nominal. Without a grid (handoff timed out, or
//! collect never produced a skeleton) rows fall back to a freeform line.
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! GitHub and GitLab only. Gitea and Azure DevOps support `pr:{N}` for a
//! single known number but have no listing path here yet.
