//! Progressive-rendering glue between `collect::collect` and the skim picker.
//!
//! Each event funnels into three places: skim's item stream (`tx`, alive
//! while updates may arrive so the picker stays non-idle), each item's
//! shared `rendered` mutex (in-place redraws), and `shared_items` used by
//! `PickerCollector` for alt-x.
//!
//! # Why updates poke a render
//!
//! skim 4.x's ratatui backend renders **on demand** — it repaints on a key
//! press, when new items land on the channel, or when its matcher flags
//! `needs_render`. It does *not* unconditionally repaint on a timer (the
//! periodic `Heartbeat` only renders when `needs_render` is already set).
//! The old skim 0.20 tuikit backend *did* repaint every 100ms, which is what
//! made in-place `rendered`-mutex mutations surface for free.
//!
//! So after the one-shot skeleton batch, every later mutation is invisible to
//! skim unless we wake it. `request_render` pushes an `Event::Render` through
//! the sender skim hands us at startup (`render_tx`, filled once the TUI is
//! initialized). Intermediate updates coalesce to [`RENDER_THROTTLE`]; the
//! terminal `on_collect_complete` forces one final unthrottled frame.
//!
//! Preview pre-compute is staged in two tiers:
//! - `on_skeleton` fires the first item's 4 modes + first-item summary,
//!   plus the default-tab mode for items 1..N (so quick j/k navigation
//!   lands on warm content). It also fills the static Summary hint for
//!   every row when summaries are disabled.
//! - `on_collect_complete` fires the secondary modes (Log / BranchDiff /
//!   UpstreamDiff) and summaries for items 1..N once the row pipeline
//!   has torn down. Preview tasks share `COLLECT_POOL` with the row
//!   pipeline. Staging keeps low-priority preview submissions out of
//!   that pool's injector while row tasks are still landing on
//!   workers' local deques during drain.
