//! The frozen, approved command plan that closes the approval-boundary TOCTOU.
//!
//! # The invariant
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md` → "Project Commands Run Only After Approval". Project-defined
//! hook commands are arbitrary code shipped in a repo the user may have just
//! cloned; they run only after the approval gate clears them.
//!
//! # Why this type exists
//!
//! Selection (*which* `(source, hook_type, name, template)` tuples run),
//! authorization (project templates ∈ [`Approvals`]) and rendering
//! (template → shell string, needs live git) are three separate concerns.
//! Operation-driven hooks (`pre-merge`, `post-merge`, `pre-remove`,
//! `post-remove`, `post-switch`, `pre-start`, `post-start`) are gated *before*
//! a state mutation (auto-rebase rewrites the feature `.config/wt.toml`; a
//! merge moves the target ref; a removal scrubs the worktree; `git worktree
//! add` materializes a `--create` worktree) and executed *after* it. When
//! selection runs a second time at execution (`load_project_config()` again),
//! the mutated on-disk config can yield an *unapproved* command. On a fresh
//! clone that is remote code execution.
//!
//! The structural fix: **the gate performs selection exactly once and freezes
//! it into an [`ApprovedHookPlan`]. Executors consume only that value.** They
//! hold no [`ProjectConfig`] and call no `load_project_config()` for the
//! covered hook types — re-derivation is a compile error, not a review check.
//! The `Repository` an executor still holds is used only for *rendering*
//! ([`render_planned`] takes the frozen [`CommandConfig`] list, never config),
//! so it cannot re-select.
//!
//! The frozen unit is the *selected, source-tagged [`CommandConfig`] list* per
//! `(HookType, anchor)` — the anchor being the worktree the hook runs in.
//! Rendering stays deferred (post-`*` hooks legitimately need post-operation
//! context like the merge commit), but it consumes
//! `&[(HookSource, CommandConfig)]`, so it cannot change the set. The
//! authorization-relevant artifact is the template set, which is exactly what
//! [`Approvals`] stores and the prompt shows.
//!
//! `ApprovedHookPlan` is obtainable *only* via [`HookPlan::approve`] (the
//! interactive / `--yes` gate) or `HookPlan::approve_readonly` (the picker,
//! which can't prompt mid-render; `#[cfg(unix)]`). [`HookPlanBuilder::add`] — the sole
//! config→commands step for the covered hooks — is the only place
//! `load_project_config()`'s result is selected from.
