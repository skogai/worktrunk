//! Worktree data collection with parallelized git operations.
//!
//! This module provides an efficient approach to collecting worktree data:
//! - All tasks flattened into a single Rayon work queue
//! - Network tasks (CI, URL) sorted to run last
//! - Progressive updates via channels (update UI as each task completes)
//!
//! ## Skeleton Performance
//!
//! The skeleton (placeholder table with loading indicators) must render as fast as possible
//! to give users immediate feedback. Every git command before skeleton adds latency.
//!
//! ### Forks on the Critical Path
//!
//! A steady-state run reaches the skeleton through five `git` subprocess
//! forks (six in repos with `extensions.worktreeConfig=true` — see #3
//! below). Fork *count* is O(1) — independent of worktree or branch
//! count — because each batches as much as it can. Fork *work* scales with
//! N (refs read, SHAs resolved); on a fast Linux system N=40 lands
//! ~30–80 ms.
//!
//! | # | Command | Source | Role |
//! |---|---------|--------|------|
//! | 1 | `git rev-parse --git-common-dir --is-inside-work-tree --show-toplevel --git-dir --symbolic-full-name HEAD` | [`Repository::prewarm`] (`prewarm_rev_parse`) | Five facts in one fork: shared `.git`, in-worktree gate, worktree root, per-worktree `.git/worktrees/<name>`, current branch. Populates process-global caches. Parallel with #2 at process startup. |
//! | 2 | `git config --list -z` (cwd = discovery path) | [`Repository::prewarm`] (`prewarm_git_config`) | Whole merged config (system + global + local) in one shot, NUL-delimited so values containing `\n` or `=` parse unambiguously. Stashed in `GIT_CONFIG_PRELOAD` keyed by discovery path; every later `config_last("…")` reads from memory. Parallel with #1. |
//! | 3 | `git config --list -z` (cwd = `git_common_dir`) | [`Repository::all_config`] | **Conditional.** [`Repository::at`] consumes #2's preload into `cache.all_config`, so `all_config()` is a memory hit on a normal repo. This fork only fires when `prewarm_git_config` declined the preload because `extensions.worktreeConfig=true` — there `--list` from a linked worktree misses the main-worktree `config.worktree` overrides (most importantly `core.bare = true` for the `myproject/.git + sibling worktrees` layout), so `all_config` re-forks from the common dir to see the full merged set. See `prewarm_git_config` for the full reasoning. |
//! | 4 | `git worktree list --porcelain` | [`Repository::list_worktrees`] | Path, HEAD SHA, branch, and flags per worktree — the row source for the skeleton. The picker prelude triggers this once for `num_items_estimate`; collect's rayon scope then hits the cache. |
//! | 5 | `git for-each-ref --format=… refs/heads/` | [`Repository::local_branches`] inside collect's `rayon::scope` | Local branch tips (name, SHA, committer date, upstream) for branch-only rows (`branches=true`) and for the stale-default-branch check. `remotes=true` adds a sibling `refs/remotes/` fork. The scope joins; this fork gates the skeleton. |
//! | 6 | `git log --no-walk --no-show-signature --format=… SHA₁ … SHA_N` | collect, after the scope | Batched commit metadata for every worktree HEAD + branch tip. See breakdown below. |
//!
//! Things that *look* like forks but aren't, on the steady-state path:
//! `git config worktrunk.default-branch`, `git config --bool core.bare`,
//! `git config remote.*.url`, [`Repository::is_bare`] — each is a
//! `config_last("…")` lookup served from #2's in-memory map (or from #3
//! when the conditional fork above did fire). They appear in the rayon
//! scope as logical fetches but no subprocess fires for them warm. The
//! same is true for [`Repository::default_branch`] once
//! `worktrunk.default-branch` is cached (the steady-state case).
//!
//! Things that fire **once per repo, ever**:
//!
//! - [`Repository::default_branch`] falling through to
//!   `git ls-remote --symref <remote> HEAD` when neither
//!   `worktrunk.default-branch` nor `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` is set.
//!   100 ms – 2 s on the wire. The result persists to
//!   `worktrunk.default-branch` so subsequent runs are a cache hit. This is
//!   worktrunk's one accepted wire-path exception — see CLAUDE.md →
//!   "Network Access".
//!
//! ### #6 — the batched commit-details fork
//!
//! ```text
//! git log --no-walk --no-show-signature \
//!   --format=%H%x00%h%x00%ct%x00%T%x00%s \
//!   SHA₁ SHA₂ … SHA_N
//! ```
//!
//! - `--no-walk` — don't traverse history. Without it, `git log SHA₁ SHA₂`
//!   walks the ancestry of each starting point and prints thousands of
//!   commits. With it, one record per named SHA. Turns this from
//!   O(history) into O(N refs).
//! - `--no-show-signature` — skip GPG verification. If `gpg.program` is set
//!   and any of these commits are signed, the default forks `gpg` per
//!   commit; disabled here.
//! - `--format=%H%x00%h%x00%ct%x00%T%x00%s` — five fields per commit,
//!   NUL-separated because subjects can contain anything except NUL:
//!   - `%H` full SHA, `%h` abbreviated SHA, `%ct` committer date (Unix
//!     epoch), `%T` tree SHA, `%s` subject (first line of message).
//!
//! SHAs come from #4 (worktree HEADs) ∪ #5 (branch tips), deduplicated.
//! Argv length scales with N — Linux `ARG_MAX` (~128 KB) bounds the
//! unchunked form at roughly 3,000 SHAs.
//!
//! What each field feeds:
//! - `%ct` — sort order on the skeleton. This is the *only* reason #6 is
//!   pre-skeleton; the skeleton can't pick row order without it.
//! - `%ct` again, post-skeleton — Age column ("3 hours ago").
//! - `%s` post-skeleton — Message column.
//! - `%h` post-skeleton — abbreviated-SHA cell.
//! - `%T` post-skeleton — primes the `commit_tree` cache so the per-row
//!   `CommittedTreesMatch` / `WouldMergeAdd` tree lookups never fork
//!   `git rev-parse <sha>^{tree}` (see [`Repository::commit_details_many`]).
//!
//! Tree SHAs, subjects, and abbreviated SHAs ride along for free: git resolves
//! each commit object to read its timestamp anyway, so the extra bytes add no
//! measurable latency to the round trip. Without this batch you'd be forking
//! `git log -1` (and `rev-parse ^{tree}`) per SHA later — same data, N forks
//! instead of one. The full `(timestamp, subject)` map is handed to the
//! post-skeleton loop that populates `ListItem.commit` directly.
//!
//! When the batch fails (e.g., a listed SHA was deleted mid-run), the
//! failure is surfaced once and Age/Message cells render placeholders for
//! that run.
//!
//! ### Non-git work on the path
//!
//! Negligible latency, but worth naming:
//! - Path canonicalization — detect current worktree.
//! - Project config file read (`.config/wt.toml`) via
//!   `ProjectConfig::load`. [`Repository::url_template`] reads `list.url`
//!   from this file — TOML I/O, not git config, and no subprocess.
//! - Config resolution — merge project-specific settings (uses cached
//!   project identifier).
//! - CI column width hint — one read of `.git/wt/cache/pr-number/max.json`
//!   (skipped when the CI task is skipped); the skeleton can't size the CI
//!   column without it.
//!
//! ### First-run behavior
//!
//! On a fresh clone with `worktrunk.default-branch` unset,
//! [`Repository::default_branch`] adds one extra step on the path: try
//! `refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD` locally, fall through to
//! `git ls-remote --symref` (the wire-path exception above), fall further
//! back to local inference (`init.defaultBranch`, common branch names).
//! The result is cached to `worktrunk.default-branch` so every subsequent
//! run is a memory hit served from #2.
//!
//! ### Post-Skeleton Operations
//!
//! After the skeleton renders, remaining setup runs before spawning the worker thread.
//! These operations are parallelized using `rayon::scope` with single-level parallelism:
//!
//! ```text
//! Skeleton render
//! ├─ is_builtin_fsmonitor_enabled()             (5ms, sequential - gate)
//! ├─ rayon::scope(
//! │    ├─ switch_previous()                     (5ms)
//! │    ├─ integration_targets()                 (10ms)
//! │    ├─ start_fsmonitor_daemon × N worktrees  (6ms each, all parallel)
//! │  )                                          // ~10ms total (max of all spawns)
//! ├─ populate ListItem.commit from cache        (cache-hit lookups, sub-ms)
//! Worker thread spawns
//! └─ paint Age/Message columns                  (workers already running)
//! ```
//!
//! **Why the Age/Message paint:** those two columns carry no task — their
//! data is the `ListItem.commit` populated above — so without an explicit
//! repaint they'd sit on the skeleton placeholder until the row's first *task*
//! result happened to redraw it, lagging behind the slower task-driven columns
//! (and a cache-warm Summary preview). The paint runs *after* the worker pool
//! is spawned — so the slow git subprocesses (the long pole) aren't delayed by
//! it — but *before* the drain renders any result, so Age/Message still reach
//! the screen ahead of every task-driven column. Reading `all_items` here is
//! race-free: the worker thread only sends results through the channel, and the
//! drain (the sole `all_items` mutator) hasn't started. `render_skeleton_row`
//! fills Age/Message from `item.commit` while every task column keeps its
//! placeholder.
//!
//! **Why fsmonitor check is sequential:** It gates whether daemon starts are needed.
//! The check is fast (~5ms) and must complete before we know which spawns to add.
//!
//! **Why fsmonitor starts are in the parallel scope:** The `git fsmonitor--daemon start`
//! command returns quickly after signaling the daemon. By the time the worker thread
//! starts executing `git status` commands, daemons have had time to initialize.
//!
//! **Stale default branch warning:** The post-skeleton `warn_stale_default`
//! check compares `default_branch()` (resolved pre-skeleton) against the
//! local branch list — reusing the list fetched for `--branches`, otherwise
//! adding one `for-each-ref` fork when the persisted default isn't a worktree branch.
//!
//! When adding new features, ask: "Can this be computed after skeleton?" If yes, defer it.
//! The skeleton shows `·` placeholder for gutter symbols, filled in when data loads.
//!
//! ### Measured Phase Timings
//!
//! Representative medians on the worktrunk dev repo (7 worktrees, 6
//! branches, warm caches, release build, `--progressive` forced so the
//! progressive-table path fires even with stdout piped).
//!
//! | Phase | median | cmds |
//! |-------|-------:|-----:|
//! | `List collect started → Skeleton rendered` (pre-skeleton) | ~60ms | 23 |
//! | `Skeleton rendered → Spawning worker thread` (rayon::scope + work-item setup) | ~41ms | 7 |
//! | `Spawning worker thread → Parallel execution started` | <100µs | 0 |
//! | `Parallel execution started → First result received` | <100µs | 0 |
//! | `First result received → All results drained` (parallel work) | ~436ms | 154 |
//! | `All results drained → List collect complete` (final render) | ~344µs | 0 |
//! | Wall clock | ~549ms | — |
//!
//! The 23-command pre-skeleton count is well above the five-to-six
//! critical-path forks documented above — worth an audit. Most of the extras
//! come from per-worktree probes that creep into the phase.
//!
//! Reproduce end-to-end via
//! `cargo bench --bench time_to_first_output -- list`; for a per-phase
//! breakdown, capture a trace and run the phase-duration SQL query from
//! `benches/CLAUDE.md`:
//!
//! ```bash
//! RUST_LOG=debug ./target/release/wt -C <repo> list --progressive \
//!   2> >(cargo run -p wt-perf --release -q -- trace > trace.json)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Unified Collection Architecture
//!
//! Progressive and buffered modes use the same collection and rendering code.
//! The only difference is whether intermediate updates are shown during collection:
//! - Progressive: renders a skeleton table and updates rows/footer as data arrives (TTY),
//!   or renders once at the end (non-TTY)
//! - Buffered: collects silently, then renders the final table
//!
//! Both modes render the final table in `collect()`, ensuring a single canonical rendering path.
//!
//! **Flat parallelism**: All tasks (for all worktrees and branches) are collected into a single
//! work queue and processed via Rayon's thread pool. This avoids nested parallelism and keeps
//! utilization high regardless of worktree count (pool size is set at startup; default is 2x CPU
//! cores unless `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` is set).
//!
//! **Task ordering**: Work items are sorted so local git operations run first, network tasks
//! (CI status, URL health checks) run last. This ensures the table fills in quickly with local
//! data while slower network requests complete in the background.
//!
//! ## Caching
//!
//! Sibling caches live under `.git/wt/cache/`. Each uses a different key scheme because
//! the underlying operations differ in what their output depends on. All three share
//! [`worktrunk::cache`] for the filesystem mechanics (read, write, clear, count) so
//! there's one implementation of the torn-write semantics and error policy across
//! every kind.
//!
//! | Directory | Module | Key | Staleness |
//! |-----------|--------|-----|-----------|
//! | `merge-tree-conflicts/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{sha1}-{sha2}.json` (sorted) | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `merge-add-probe/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{branch_sha}-{target_sha}.json` | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `is-ancestor/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{base_sha}-{head_sha}.json` | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `has-added-changes/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{branch_sha}-{target_sha}.json` | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `diff-stats/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{base_sha}-{head_sha}.json` | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `ahead-behind/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{base_sha}-{head_sha}.json` | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `merge-base/` | `git::repository::sha_cache` | `{sha1}-{sha2}.json` (sorted) | Never — content-addressed |
//! | `ci-status/` | `commands::list::ci_status::cache` | `{branch}.json` | TTL 30–60s + HEAD SHA check |
//! | `summary/{branch}/` | `summary` | `{diff_hash}.json` | Miss if no file exists for the current hash; siblings pruned on write |
//!
//! ### Key schemes
//!
//! - **SHA-pair**: pure function of two commit SHAs. Never stale, no TTL, no invalidation.
//!   Used by all `sha_cache` kinds (merge-tree conflicts, merge-add probes, ancestry
//!   checks, file-change probes, diff stats, ahead/behind counts, merge-base).
//! - **Branch + TTL + HEAD**: external mutable state (CI API, remote refs). TTL bounds
//!   staleness; the HEAD check invalidates early when the branch moves.
//! - **Branch + content-addressed hash in filename**: content hash (SHA-256
//!   prefix of the combined diff) lives in the filename, so a cache hit is
//!   "file exists for this hash". Prune-on-write removes stale sibling hashes
//!   for the branch, keeping the cache bounded at ~1 entry per branch without
//!   needing an LRU sweep.
//!
//! ### Which tasks hit which cache
//!
//! | Task | Cache |
//! |------|-------|
//! | `MergeTreeConflicts` | `sha_cache` (merge-tree-conflicts) |
//! | `WorkingTreeConflicts` | `sha_cache` (merge-tree-conflicts, tree-SHA keyed) |
//! | `WouldMergeAdd` | `sha_cache` (merge-add-probe) |
//! | `IsAncestor` | `sha_cache` (is-ancestor) |
//! | `HasFileChanges` | `sha_cache` (has-added-changes) |
//! | `BranchDiff` | `sha_cache` (diff-stats, skipped when sparse checkout is active) |
//! | `AheadBehind`, `Upstream` | `sha_cache` (ahead-behind for counts, merge-base for the orphan check); on a cold cache both columns are pre-filled from `for-each-ref %(ahead-behind:SHA)` walks — one against the default branch (`main↕`, in `RefSnapshot::capture_ahead_behind`) and one per unique upstream SHA (`Remote⇅`, in `Repository::prime_upstream_ahead_behind_cache`) |
//! | `CiStatus` | `ci_status::cache` |
//! | `SummaryGenerate` | `summary` |
//!
//! Every other task re-runs on each invocation.
//!
//! ### Already optimized (not cache candidates)
//!
//! - `CommittedTreesMatch` — resolves both commit→tree SHAs through the
//!   in-memory `commit_tree` cache, which the pre-skeleton commit-details
//!   `git log` batch primes via `%T` (see [`Repository::commit_details_many`]).
//!   So on the `wt list` path it forks nothing per row — the tree SHAs are
//!   already in memory.
//!
//! ### Cached via tree SHA
//!
//! `WorkingTreeConflicts` uses `git write-tree` to snapshot the index as a tree SHA,
//! then checks for merge conflicts via `has_merge_conflicts_by_tree_with_base_sha`. The tree SHA is
//! content-addressed and stable — identical index state produces the same SHA.
//!
//! When there are unstaged modifications or untracked files, the task copies the
//! index to a temp file, runs `git add -A` to stage all working tree content,
//! then `write-tree`.
//!
//! The cache key is `(base_commit_sha, branch_head_sha+tree_sha)`. The branch HEAD
//! SHA captures the merge-base dependency. On cache miss, `has_merge_conflicts_by_tree_with_base_sha`
//! creates an ephemeral commit via `git commit-tree` for merge-tree; on cache hit,
//! no commit is created. This makes the cache-hit path a single `git write-tree`
//! (~15ms) instead of the previous `git stash create` (~50-265ms).
//!
//! ### Fundamentally uncacheable
//!
//! Some task outputs depend on state outside the commit graph:
//!
//! - `WorkingTreeDiff` — uncommitted changes and index state
//! - `GitOperation` — presence of `.git/rebase-merge`, `.git/rebase-apply`, or `MERGE_HEAD`
//! - `UserMarker` — local git config value
//! - `UrlStatus` — TCP connect to a local dev server port; real-time by nature
//!
//! All but `UrlStatus` are cheap enough that caching would not pay back. `UrlStatus` is
//! bounded at 50ms per item; a stale "active" result when the server just died is worse
//! than the probe cost.
