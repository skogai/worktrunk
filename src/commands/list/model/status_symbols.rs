//! Status symbol types and per-symbol atomic rendering rules.
//!
//! # Goal
//!
//! Each symbol in the Status column is computed and rendered independently.
//! A symbol only appears once we have the data needed to compute **that
//! specific symbol**. Symbols whose inputs have not arrived render as a
//! position-level loading / timeout placeholder, and stay that way if the
//! drain deadline fires before the data lands.
//!
//! The core rule is: **each position is atomic in its own inputs**. The cell
//! as a whole is never atomic — parts that are ready render; parts that are
//! not render `·`.
//!
//! # Positions
//!
//! The Status column has seven rendered positions (see [`PositionMask`]).
//! They render left-to-right and are independently gated:
//!
//! | # | Name                | Symbols              | Answers                               |
//! |---|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
//! | 0 | `STAGED`            | `+`                  | Are there staged changes?             |
//! | 1 | `MODIFIED`          | `!`                  | Are there unstaged modifications?     |
//! | 2 | `UNTRACKED`         | `?`                  | Are there untracked files?            |
//! | 3 | `WORKTREE_STATE`    | `✘ ⤴ ⤵ ⚑ ⊟ ⊞ /`      | Operation / worktree attribute        |
//! | 4 | `MAIN_STATE`        | `^ ✗ _ – ⊂ ↕ ↑ ↓`    | Relationship to the default branch    |
//! | 5 | `UPSTREAM_DIVERGENCE` | \| ⇅ ⇡ ⇣           | Relationship to the tracked remote    |
//! | 6 | `USER_MARKER`       | emoji / text         | User-defined annotation               |
//!
//! Positions 0–2 are three visual slots but **one logical decision** — they
//! all come from `data.working_tree_status` and resolve together. Each of
//! positions 3, 4, 5, 6 is an independent logical decision with its own
//! input set. There are effectively **five independent gates** on the Status
//! cell.
//!
//! # Gate 1: Working tree flags (positions 0–2)
//!
//! **Renders:** any combination of `+`, `!`, `?` (plus `»` / `✘` for renamed
//! / deleted when used).
//!
//! **Inputs:** `data.working_tree_status` — produced by the `WorkingTreeDiff`
//! task, or seeded at spawn time for items whose tasks will not run.
//!
//! **Rule:**
//! - `Some(_)` → render the flags it contains. A clean tree leaves all three
//!   positions blank.
//! - `None` → the lead position (`STAGED`) renders the `·` placeholder; the
//!   other two positions render blank. The gate is one logical decision, so
//!   one `·` represents it — matching the visual weight of the
//!   single-position gates 2–5.
//!
//! Branches and prunable worktrees seed `working_tree_status` to a "no
//! working tree" sentinel at spawn time, so their positions render blank,
//! not `·`.
//!
//! # Gate 2: Worktree state (position 3)
//!
//! **Renders:** at most one of `✘ ⤴ ⤵ ⚑ ⊟ ⊞ /`, priority
//! `✘ > ⤴ > ⤵ > ⚑ > ⊟ > ⊞ > /`. The operation family (`✘⤴⤵`) comes from live
//! task data; the attribute family (`⚑⊟⊞/`) is metadata, always known.
//!
//! **Inputs:** `data.has_conflicts`, `data.git_operation`, plus metadata
//! (`locked`, `prunable`, `branch_worktree_mismatch`, `ItemKind::Branch`).
//!
//! **Rule — short-circuit on priority:** a higher-priority signal, once known
//! to be positive, resolves the gate immediately without waiting for
//! lower-priority signals. Formally, render as soon as we can identify which
//! row of the priority table is the answer:
//!
//! 1. `has_conflicts == Some(true)` → `✘`.
//! 2. `has_conflicts == Some(false)` and `git_operation == Some(Rebase)` → `⤴`.
//! 3. `has_conflicts == Some(false)` and `git_operation == Some(Merge)` → `⤵`.
//! 4. `has_conflicts == Some(false)` and `git_operation == Some(None)` and
//!    metadata says mismatched → `⚑`.
//! 5. …continuing down through `⊟`, `⊞`, `/`, nothing.
//!
//! Until both `has_conflicts` and `git_operation` are known, we cannot rule
//! out `✘/⤴/⤵`, so the position renders `·` even if metadata would otherwise
//! produce `⊟` or `⊞`.
//!
//! **Exception — items with no working tree:** branches and prunable
//! worktrees have seeded sentinels (`has_conflicts = Some(false)`,
//! `git_operation = Some(None)`) at spawn time, so the operation family is
//! ruled out immediately and metadata wins.
//!
//! # Gate 3: Main state (position 4)
//!
//! **Renders:** at most one of `^ ✗ _ – ⊂ ↕ ↑ ↓`. Priority:
//! `IsMain > Orphan > WouldConflict > Empty(_) > SameCommitDirty(–) >
//! Integrated(⊂) > Diverged(↕) > Ahead(↑) > Behind(↓) > None`.
//!
//! **Inputs:**
//! - `is_main` (metadata)
//! - `is_orphan` (from `AheadBehind`)
//! - `has_merge_tree_conflicts` (from `MergeTreeConflicts`)
//! - `has_working_tree_conflicts` (from `WorkingTreeConflicts`)
//! - Integration signals: `is_ancestor`, `committed_trees_match`,
//!   `has_file_changes`, `would_merge_add`, `is_patch_id_match`
//! - `counts` (from `AheadBehind`)
//! - `working_tree_diff` + `working_tree_status` (used for `is_clean`, which
//!   distinguishes `Empty(_)` from `SameCommitDirty(–)`)
//!
//! **Rule — short-circuit on priority (same pattern as gate 2):** render as
//! soon as the priority-winning signal can be identified.
//!
//! 1. `is_main == true` (metadata) → `^`. Always immediate for the main
//!    worktree, regardless of any other field.
//! 2. `is_orphan == Some(true)` → orphan display.
//! 3. `has_working_tree_conflicts == Some(Some(true))` (dirty-tree probe
//!    is authoritative when present) or `has_merge_tree_conflicts == Some(true)`
//!    → `✗`. When the dirty-tree probe says `Some(Some(false))` it rules
//!    out tier 3 even if the HEAD probe was skipped (see
//!    [`tier_would_conflict`](super::state::tier_would_conflict)).
//! 4. Distinguish Empty / SameCommitDirty / Integrated — requires `counts`,
//!    `is_clean` (from `working_tree_diff` + `working_tree_status` for
//!    worktrees; trivially clean for branches), and the integration signals.
//!    Render as soon as all signals needed to pick a row have landed.
//! 5. Otherwise fall through to `↕/↑/↓/None` from `counts`.
//!
//! **Exception — unborn items (`HEAD == NULL_OID`):** all commit-dependent
//! tasks are skipped at spawn time. Their fields are seeded with "no commits"
//! sentinels (`counts = (0, 0)`, `is_orphan = false`, integration signals
//! conservatively false, `has_merge_tree_conflicts = false`). With those
//! seeded, gate 3 resolves to `None` for unborn non-main items and the row
//! still renders.
//!
//! **Exception — stale branches and `--skip-tasks`:** fields for
//! deliberately-skipped tasks are seeded at spawn time with conservative
//! defaults. Stale branches can render a less-specific main-state symbol
//! than fresh ones (e.g., `↕` instead of `⊂`).
//!
//! # Gate 4: Upstream divergence (position 5)
//!
//! **Renders:** at most one of `| ⇅ ⇡ ⇣`.
//!
//! **Inputs:** `upstream` (from `Upstream`).
//!
//! **Rule:**
//! - `Some(UpstreamStatus::None)` → nothing (no upstream configured).
//! - `Some(active)` → render the divergence glyph from `active.ahead/behind`.
//! - `None` → `·`.
//!
//! **Exception — unborn:** `Upstream` is a `COMMIT_TASK` and is skipped for
//! unborn items. `upstream` is seeded to "no upstream" at spawn time so
//! gate 4 renders blank for unborn rows, not `·`.
//!
//! # Gate 5: User marker (position 6)
//!
//! **Renders:** whatever the user's marker lookup produced.
//!
//! **Inputs:** `user_marker` (from `UserMarker`).
//!
//! **Rule:**
//! - `Some(Some(s))` → render `s`.
//! - `Some(None)` → nothing (no marker for this item).
//! - `None` → `·`.
//!
//! # Rendering `·` at the position level
//!
//! `·` is a position-level placeholder emitted by the render function for
//! each gate that hasn't resolved yet. It takes the full allocated width of
//! its position so table alignment is preserved across rows.
//!
//! An in-progress cell might look like:
//!
//! ```text
//! +!  · ↕ | ·     ← staged + modified known; worktree state + user marker still loading
//! ·   · ^ | ·     ← main worktree known from metadata; other gates still loading
//!     ^ | 💬      ← everything resolved: main worktree, in sync, user marker
//! ```
//!
//! TODO: loading and post-deadline timeout both render as the same dim `·`
//! today. The original design distinguished them (`⋯` vs `·`) but `⋯` was
//! too loud for a tight Status column where most cells are in one state or
//! the other at any given render. Pick a subtle second glyph — e.g., a
//! single-dot braille or an en-dash — once the two can be evaluated
//! side-by-side in real tables. See `PLACEHOLDER` in `render.rs`.
//!
//! # Timeout behavior
//!
//! When the drain deadline fires (`wt switch` picker budget,
//! `[list].timeout-ms`):
//!
//! 1. Each position's last-known state is displayed: resolved positions show
//!    their symbol; unresolved positions show `·`.
//! 2. The diagnostic footer already lists which tasks did not finish per
//!    item — this continues unchanged and gives the user the mapping from
//!    "`·` in position X" back to "`TaskKind::Foo` timed out."
//! 3. JSON output omits fields that correspond to unresolved gates
//!    (`working_tree`, `main_state`, `operation_state`, `upstream_divergence`,
//!    etc.) so machine consumers can distinguish "loading / timeout" from
//!    "loaded with no symbol."
//!
//! # Error handling
//!
//! A task that errors counts as "result received, carrying no information."
//! The affected field remains `None` and its gate renders `·`. There is **no
//! conservative-defaults fallback** for errored status-feeder tasks — a
//! failed `WorkingTreeDiff` shows `·` in positions 0–2 and 3, not a
//! fabricated clean state. The error itself is still captured and shown in
//! the post-render diagnostic section.
//!
//! # Data model
//!
//! Each gate's output is an `Option` inside [`StatusSymbols`]. `None` means
//! loading / unresolved; `Some(default)` means resolved with nothing to
//! display; `Some(value)` means resolved with a symbol.
//!
//! ```text
//! pub struct StatusSymbols {
//!     working_tree: Option<WorkingTreeStatus>,          // positions 0–2 (one decision)
//!     worktree_state: Option<ResolvedWorktreeState>,    // position 3
//!     main_state: Option<MainState>,                    // position 4
//!     upstream_divergence: Option<Divergence>,          // position 5
//!     user_marker: Option<Option<String>>,              // position 6
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! `item.status_symbols` is always `Some(StatusSymbols::default())` after the
//! skeleton render — every gate starts as `None` → `·`. Per-gate resolution
//! populates individual fields as task results arrive.
//!
//! `refresh_status_symbols` (replacing the current "all or nothing"
//! `compute_status_symbols`) is called after every drain tick: it tries each
//! gate independently and sets any fields whose inputs are now ready. It is
//! idempotent — a gate, once resolved, is never un-resolved.
//!
//! # Non-goals
//!
//! - **Animated `·`.** Out of scope.
//! - **Partial rendering within a gate.** Gate 3 does not render `⊟` just
//!   because prunable metadata says so — it waits until the operation family
//!   can be ruled out. Atomicity *within* a gate is preserved; only *between*
//!   gates are decisions independent.
//! - **Retrying timed-out or errored tasks.** Separate concern.
//! - **Tuning picker budgets or task skip lists.** This spec only defines
//!   what happens when data does or does not arrive in time.
