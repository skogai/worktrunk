//! Hook filter types for command filtering by source and name.
//!
//! These types are shared between `hooks.rs` (command preparation/execution)
//! and `command_approval.rs` (approval flow). Re-exported from `hooks.rs`
//! for backward compatibility.

/// Whether a hook or alias body came from user config or project config.
///
/// Drives the per-step trust model: user-source bodies skip approval and
/// pass EXEC through (the config is the user's own); project-source bodies
/// require approval at the gate (command entry point) and scrub EXEC.
