# Benchmark Guidelines

See `list.rs` and `time_to_first_output.rs` headers for benchmark groups and run examples.

## Quick Start

Criterion's CLI takes a positional `FILTER` (substring inclusion) and `--exact`. There's no `--skip`; pick a filter that *includes* what you want instead.

```bash
# Fast iteration (one synthetic group, warm cache only)
cargo bench --bench list skeleton/warm

# Run specific group (all variants)
cargo bench --bench list many_branches

# GH #461 scenario (200 branches on rust-lang/rust)
cargo bench --bench list real_repo_many_branches

# All list benchmarks (~1 hour)
cargo bench --bench list

# Time-to-first-output benchmarks
cargo bench --bench time_to_first_output         # all commands
cargo bench --bench time_to_first_output remove  # just remove
```

## Rust Repo Caching

Real repo benchmarks clone rust-lang/rust on first run (~2-5 minutes). The clone is cached in `target/bench-repos/` and reused. Corrupted caches are auto-recovered.

## Faster Iteration

Criterion has no exclusion flag — narrow the run by picking a substring that matches only the variants you want. Benchmark IDs look like `<group>/<label>/<param>`, e.g. `skeleton/cold/4`, `worktree_scaling/warm/8`, `real_repo_many_branches/warm`.

**Pattern matching (positional `FILTER`):**
```bash
cargo bench --bench list scaling             # All worktree_scaling/* variants
cargo bench --bench list warm                # Every benchmark whose ID contains "warm"
cargo bench --bench list skeleton/warm       # Just skeleton's warm variants
cargo bench --bench list -- --exact full/cold/4   # One exact ID
```

To skip the slow real-repo and divergent groups, target the synthetic groups directly: `cargo bench --bench list skeleton`, `cargo bench --bench list full`, or `cargo bench --bench list worktree_scaling`. Run them sequentially if you want more than one.

## WORKTRUNK_FIRST_OUTPUT

Setting `WORKTRUNK_FIRST_OUTPUT=1` causes commands to exit at the point where first
user-visible output would appear. Used by `time_to_first_output` benchmarks to measure
startup latency without output rendering or post-output work (mismatch warnings, hooks).

Supported commands: `switch`, `remove`, `list`.

## Cache Handling

Worktrunk maintains a persistent SHA-keyed cache at `.git/wt/cache/` plus a git-config
cache of the default branch at `worktrunk.default-branch`. Both survive process exits,
so bench iterations read from prior iterations unless invalidated.

**Rule:** if a benchmark runs a `wt` subcommand that populates these caches, every
iteration must start cold — otherwise iter 1 measures the real cost and iter 2+ measure
a cache hit. Invalidate via `criterion::Bencher::iter_batched` with
`wt_perf::invalidate_caches_auto` as the setup closure (see the cold-cache variants in
`benches/list.rs` and `benches/remove.rs` for the pattern).

`invalidate_caches_auto` clears:

- `.git/index` (main and linked worktrees)
- `.git/objects/info/commit-graph*`
- `.git/packed-refs`
- `.git/wt/cache/` (all sha_cache kinds + ci-status + summaries)
- `worktrunk.default-branch` (git config)

User state — `worktrunk.history`, `worktrunk.hints.*`, `worktrunk.state.<branch>.*`,
`.git/wt/logs/`, `.git/wt/trash/` — is intentionally preserved. It doesn't affect
read-path performance and benches may depend on it (e.g., branch markers set during
setup).

**Which commands populate `.git/wt/cache/`:**

| Command | Populates? | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `wt list` | Yes | Post-skeleton tasks. Exits early under `WORKTRUNK_SKELETON_ONLY=1` / `WORKTRUNK_FIRST_OUTPUT=1` — those skip the writing phase. |
| `wt remove` | Yes | `prepare_worktree_removal` → `compute_integration_lazy` writes `is-ancestor` / `has-added-changes` / `merge-add-probe` whenever `BranchDeletionMode` is not `ForceDelete` (CLI `--force` is `force_worktree`, not `--force-delete`). |
| `wt switch` | No | No sha_cache writers on the switch path. |
| `wt` (completion via `COMPLETE=$SHELL`) | No | Only `for-each-ref` + worktree list. |

Default-branch cache contribution is ~17ms per iteration on a typical-8 synthetic repo
(measured: 166ms with default-branch cached → 183ms fully cold). Small enough that
always clearing it is simpler than introducing a "warm default-branch" bench mode.

**Bench fixtures don't exercise the wire path.** `setup_fake_remote` writes
`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` directly into every repo, so a cold-cache iteration
falls through to the local `<r>/HEAD` lookup (~17 ms above), never to
`git ls-remote` (100 ms–2 s in the wild). The cold cost we benchmark is the
*configured-remote* cold cost, not the *fresh-clone* cold cost. A
`cold_no_remote` mode (extending `invalidate_caches_auto` to also wipe
`refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`) would close the gap if the wire-path cost is
worth measuring at CI cadence.

## Expected Performance

**Modest repos** (500 commits, 100 files):
- Cold cache penalty: ~5-16% slower
- Scaling: Linear with worktree count

**Large repos** (rust-lang/rust):
- Cold cache penalty: ~4x slower for single worktree
- Scaling: Warm cache shows superlinear degradation, cold cache scales better

## Output Locations

- Results: `target/criterion/`
- Cached rust repo: `target/bench-repos/rust/`
- HTML reports: `target/criterion/*/report/index.html`

## Performance Investigation with wt-perf

Use `wt-perf` to set up benchmark repos and generate Chrome Trace Format for visualization.

### Setting up benchmark repos

```bash
# Set up a repo with 8 worktrees (persists at /tmp/wt-perf-typical-8)
cargo run -p wt-perf -- setup typical-8 --persist

# Available configs:
#   typical-N       - 500 commits, 100 files, N worktrees
#   branches-N      - N branches, 1 commit each
#   branches-N-M    - N branches, M commits each
#   divergent       - 200 branches × 20 commits (GH #461 scenario)
#   picker-test     - Config for wt switch interactive picker testing

# Invalidate caches for cold run
cargo run -p wt-perf -- invalidate /tmp/wt-perf-typical-8/main
```

### Generating traces

`wt-perf timeline` runs a `wt` invocation, captures `[wt-trace]` records,
and renders. Default mode is a sorted text timeline; `--chrome` emits
Chrome Trace Format JSON for Perfetto/chrome://tracing. `--cold`
invalidates caches first.

```bash
# Text timeline of one wt invocation
cargo run -p wt-perf -- timeline -- list --progressive

# Cold-cache run
cargo run -p wt-perf -- timeline --cold --repo /tmp/wt-perf-typical-8 -- \
  -C /tmp/wt-perf-typical-8 list --progressive

# Chrome Trace Format JSON for Perfetto
cargo run -p wt-perf -- timeline --chrome -- list --progressive > trace.json
# Open in https://ui.perfetto.dev or chrome://tracing
```

`--progressive` is still required: `wt-perf timeline` runs wt with stdout
piped to /dev/null, so TTY-gated events (`Skeleton rendered`, `First
result received`) won't fire without it.

For Chrome JSON from a log already captured to disk (e.g. a CI artifact),
pipe through `wt-perf trace` instead:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug wt list --progressive --branches 2> captured.log
cargo run -p wt-perf -- trace < captured.log > trace.json
```

The text-timeline summary reports `traced` (first → last `[wt-trace]`
record, what the spans actually cover) and `wall` (externally-measured
spawn → wait, the true process duration). The gap between them is
prelude/epilogue not visible to the trace — process spawn, dyld, code
that runs before `init_logging` registers the trace epoch, and the exit
path after the last span drops.

### Querying with trace_processor

Install [trace_processor](https://perfetto.dev/docs/analysis/trace-processor) for SQL analysis:

```bash
curl -LO https://get.perfetto.dev/trace_processor && chmod +x trace_processor
```

### Performance questions

Three questions drive `wt list` performance work:

1. **Where does time go?** Which subprocess types consume the most total time? The category with the highest `total_ms` is where optimization effort has the most impact.

2. **How parallel are we?** Total subprocess time divided by wall time gives a parallelism factor. A factor of 4.0 means 4 commands running concurrently on average. Close to 1.0 means mostly serial execution with headroom to parallelize.

3. **What's on the critical path?** The critical path passes through serial phases (setup, finalization) plus the slowest work item in the parallel phase. We don't have good queries for this yet — the trace format doesn't capture task dependencies, and rayon's work-stealing means thread IDs don't map to worktrees. The queries below are a starting point (phase boundaries from milestones, per-worktree time from args) but don't give a real critical path answer. Visualizing the trace in Perfetto is more useful here.

### Queries

### Generating traces from benchmark repos

```bash
# Trace on rust-lang/rust (must run benchmark first to clone)
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --release -q -- -C target/bench-repos/rust list --progressive --branches 2>&1 \
  | cargo run -p wt-perf -- trace > rust-trace.json
```

## Key Performance Insights

**`git for-each-ref %(ahead-behind:BASE)` is O(commits), not O(refs)**

This command walks the commit graph to compute divergence. On rust-lang/rust:
- Takes ~2s regardless of how many refs are queried
- Only way to avoid it is to not enumerate branches at all

**Branch enumeration costs** (rust-lang/rust with 50 branches):
- First run (cold persistent cache): ~15-18s (expensive merge-base/merge-tree per branch)
- Subsequent runs (warm persistent cache): ~2-3s (cache hits on merge-tree / integration probes / diff stats / ancestry)
- Worktrees only: ~600ms (no branch enumeration)

The persistent SHA-keyed cache (`.git/wt/cache/`) amortizes the first-run cost across
subsequent invocations. Cache entries are eternally valid since they're keyed on commit
SHAs.
