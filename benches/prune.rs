// Benchmarks for `wt step prune` end-to-end performance
//
// Prune has two cost centers with different shapes:
//
//   1. The scan — one integration check per worktree and per local branch,
//      parallel on the rayon pool. Dominated by the merge-tree/merge-base
//      probes, whose results persist in `.git/wt/cache/` (sha_cache), so the
//      first scan after new commits is cold and later scans are warm.
//   2. The removals — each integrated candidate runs the removal chain
//      (final clean check, fsmonitor stop, rename-to-trash, branch CAS
//      delete) serially under the write side of the scan lock, reusing the
//      removal plan its scan check computed.
//
// The fixture is `wt_perf::create_prune_repo`: squash-merged candidates
// (integrated by content — the expensive probe path, the post-PR-squash shape
// prune typically removes) against a two-sided-diverged backdrop of unmerged
// worktrees and branches (forked deep in history while main advanced) that
// are scanned every run but never removed.
//
// Benchmark variants:
//   - prune_e2e/dry_run_cold — full scan, sha_cache invalidated per iteration
//   - prune_e2e/dry_run_warm — full scan, caches warm (steady-state re-run)
//   - prune_e2e/live        — scan + removal of the squash-merged candidates,
//                             which are re-created before every iteration
//   - prune_real_repo/      — warm dry-run on a rust-lang/rust clone with
//     dry_run_warm            both populations at "dozens of worktrees" scale
//                             (cached ~15 GiB fixture; first-ever run clones,
//                             minutes). Opt-in via `--features
//                             real-repo-benches` so the daily CI benchmarks
//                             job never builds it; cold and live at this
//                             scale are one-shot timelines, not criterion
//                             groups (see below)
//
// Run examples:
//   cargo bench --bench prune                # Synthetic variants
//   cargo bench --bench prune --features real-repo-benches prune_real_repo
//
// For phase attribution (scan vs per-candidate removal), trace one invocation
// instead: `wt-perf setup prune-4-8 --path /tmp/prune-repo --persist`, then
// `wt-perf timeline -- -C /tmp/prune-repo step prune --dry-run --min-age 0s`
// and read the `prune-gather` / `prune-scan` / `prune-check:*` /
// `prune-remove:*` spans.
