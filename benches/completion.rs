//! Shell-completion latency (`COMPLETE=$SHELL wt -- wt switch <Tab>`).
//!
//! This is the one wt path a user waits on with their finger still on Tab, so
//! the number that matters is whole-process wall time. It runs the real binary
//! the way a shell does — the completion handler answers and returns before
//! `main` builds the rayon pool or parses a command, so nothing here shares
//! state with an ordinary `wt` invocation.
//!
//! **One benchmark, on the `mixed` fixture `full` already uses.** Completion
//! has no phases worth timing separately: it spawns, fills its caches on one
//! set of threads, scans refs and worktrees on another, prints, exits.
//! Splitting that into a variant per dimension re-measures the same startup
//! over a series of deliberately lopsided repos and still can't say which call
//! moved, because the calls within a wave overlap. Localizing a regression is a
//! trace's job here, exactly as it is for `full` — see "Analyzing a trace" in
//! benches/CLAUDE.md, and note that a `-vv` run has no prewarm and so is not
//! the run users get.
//!
//! `mixed-80-80-1400` is that one repo: 80 worktrees in four states, 80 more
//! branches forked across 200 commits of history, and 1400 remote-tracking
//! refs. It covers all three categories `BranchCompleter` distinguishes, puts
//! both candidate slow calls (`for-each-ref refs/remotes/` and `worktree list
//! --porcelain`) in the same process at a size where each is expensive, and
//! lands past the completer's 100-entry threshold — where the remote refs are
//! scanned and then discarded, as they are on a real long-lived clone.
//!
//! The remote-ref count is what this bench adds to the shared fixture; `full`
//! passes 0 and is unaffected.
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo bench --bench completion
//! cargo run -p wt-perf -- setup mixed-80-80-1400 --path /tmp/clone   # same repo, by hand
//! ```
